   Review Name: Terrific 
   Review Description: Awesome AC, I use it at 40% energy between 27-28 degrees during night and around 28-29 degrees during daytime, it cools perfectly fine. Silent operation and good set of features especially hoping energy control reduces the bills.
Decent looks.
Installation is by LG and in Delhi it was a pleasent experience. Only extra charge was for installation of stand as I already purchased one.
Hoping for hassle free operations in future.
