   Review Name: Don't waste your money 
   Review Description: The rating does not justify the electricity usage, this 5 star is using the same electricity as a normal 3 star or 2 star AC.

I have been using Voltas and Daikin AC and they use less electricity even being a 3 Star appliance.

The cooling is okay, not bad. If you want to buy LG, then go for 3 star do not pay extra just for rating sticker.
