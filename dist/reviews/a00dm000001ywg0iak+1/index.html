   Review Name: Could be way better 
   Review Description: Pros : Cooling is good, Super silent which was enough for my smaller room(120sqft.)
At night even 40% efficiency at 25 deg is enough.

Cons : Smaller ac as compared to other 1.5ton acs.
Cooling capacity is 4600 as compared to >5000 in others. So overall tonnage should be around 1.3-1.4
2 way swing only.
Fin movement is limited to only 45 degree towards up. It doesnt cover rest 45 degree downwards(my major concern - as bed is right below the ac and I dont get ac air flow.)
Installation price too high for a 30 min work. It should be borne by company.  

For me 3 star efficiency doesnt matter due to limited time use. AI mode hardly any practical use. Wifi doesnt matter unless it reacts to IR sensor in some phones.
Overall value for money product if above are not your limitations.
