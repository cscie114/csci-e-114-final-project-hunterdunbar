   Review Description: Wastage of money 
A Very bad experience with blue star. Noise level of this product is 44 db after this specification the sound of this product is so loudly. Technician said this is the normal speed of fan/blower. Really i am not happy with is product. And please don't buy this for your home bcoz its better for a rushed or marketyard type areas.
