   Review Description: Writing my review after 13days of installation.
Cooling is amazing....my room is around 200sqm bt....it covers the whole room n make it chilled.... it is also energy efficient as the compressor stops running automatically when AC is running at 25 after cooling the room.....when the room temperature exceeds the compressor again gets restart and cools the room in dis way it consumes less energy....thus no doubt to mention that the product is value for money...
If u r looking for window AC go for Voltas .....
I got it at a gud price during sale.....a worthy product... thanks Flipkart for giving dis product option n also for timely delivery.
