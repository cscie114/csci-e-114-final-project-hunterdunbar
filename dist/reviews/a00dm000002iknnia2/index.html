   Review Name: Perfect product! 
   Review Description: Initially I had a faulty ( damaged maybe in transit ) outer unit as the gas leaked soon after it gave cooling for once after installation. I had complained to voltas toll free number & their person visited & found gas had leaked.Thereafter the outsourced  installing agency  refilled the gas. However there was no cooling as the gas kept leaking. Second inspection by company person revealed that there was leakage due to some damage deep inside the outer unit.  Voltas company however promptly replaced the outer unit all new (though had to keep calling). However all that ends well is well. Friends it's not common that companies accept fault & replace the product like Voltas did in my case. Full marks to Voltas company for their fairly prompt response. Yes the new unit is working excellent. This particular model cools fast, makes less noise which suggest that it consumes less energy. I was NOT charged single paisa  for either gas filling or  replacement. Everything was done FREE of cost. Thanks Mr shah who is concerned complaint related national level officer of Voltas, thanks Mr. Sunil Zaware who is Voltas concerned officer for Gujarat, Thanks Shri Ankurbhai of Voltas Ahmedabad, his technician Shri Kalubhai & not the least a big thanks to Flipkart.
