   Review Name: Terrific 
   Review Description: I got it installed 2 days back. Unit is working very nice in a 10 feet by 10 feet room. I tried using it at 40 percent efficiency too. At 40 percent efficiency mode, it brought room temperature from 31 degrees to 25 degrees in 9 minutes, which was impressive. Installation was charged 1900 INR by the engineer, including 999 rs for standard installation charge, plus 900 INR for wall bracket. Using it without stabilizer, and it works fine.
