   Review Name: Highly recommended 
   Review Description: Product good. Do try to work around with the LG guys who comes for installation (prefer looking at installation process & costing if ur buying for 1st time) Buy a AC 3pin as its not part of product or installation. 

Cost me around 10k (had to install grill for outer unit per installation guy, which could have been avoided)
