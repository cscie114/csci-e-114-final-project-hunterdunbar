   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Good cooling. The product is excellent , Tata product is usual, but the Installation team is worst, they demanded high amount of money for their stand , water pipe and electric cable. The higger authority of TATA company must look into the matter to keep the company image in the present competitive market ..
