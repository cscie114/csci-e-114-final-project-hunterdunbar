   Review Name: Value-for-money 
   Review Description: Over all it is good. It will take less than 10 mins to cool my room and my room size is 9*12 square feet.Only one concern after using one and half month is that it consume avarage 2 units per hour though it has inverter and it is a 5 star rating ac. 
 
Delivery was good received the product on the next day of order. 

For installation I have paid around 4.5k including pipe cover and all. The installation team also asked me to purchase  stabilizer so I have paid additional 3.5k for that.
