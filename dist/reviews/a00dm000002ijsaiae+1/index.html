   Review Name: Perfect product! 
   Review Description: Best air conditioner from the best brand. Isn't it? It's been a couple of months and this ac, cooling is just the best in class. Whatever the temperature outside, it'll make you shiver even at 24Â°C. I must say it's the best ac at this price. You must go for it.
