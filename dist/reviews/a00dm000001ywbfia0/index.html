   Review Name: Pathetic installtion service 
   Review Description: First the voltas AC is really good, all copper, chill fast but not good service from flipkart, Delivered wrong time slot, Wrong AC delivered (Not look like in display). Next the pathetic experience was installation(by jeeves). They collect from me extra bucks 1800rs for extra copper line and wire. When I ask for receipt they told me you will get on your registered email. Still waiting for bill. Now my outlet ac have water spilling on joint because of they did not jointed it well. I called jeeves and flipkart. They are referring me service center. So guys better to buy offline or reputed store..
