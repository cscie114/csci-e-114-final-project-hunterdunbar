   Review Name: Good quality product 
   Review Description: Ac is very good and happy with on-time delivery. 
But little bit disappointed with installation. Proper check was not done by the engineer post installation otherwise he could have found the gas leakage.
The ac was repaired by the engineers next day but after many follow-ups. Otherwise I would have given 5 out of 5 rating.
