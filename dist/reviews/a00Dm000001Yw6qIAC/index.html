   Review Name: Great product 
   Review Description: Have been using this for 8 months now. Very efficient cooling. I don't use this daily. Maybe once a week. Temperature is set to usually around 27 degrees. ECO mode is actually not that great. Normal cooling mode would suffice
Louver moves horizontally only. 2 way swing. Not 4 way. Recommended to set the fan mode to auto. Remote is ok, no backlight. AC display can be switched off. Highly recommended to use the free service to avoid warranty issues. 
It cools fast. Fan blower is loud at High & Medium speed. Very quiet only at low speed. 
I'm using it with a stabilizer. 

Product was delivered on time. Installtion from JEEVES is waste. They overcharge. I got it installed locally with less than half of what they charge. Recommend not to use the installation from JEEVES unless it's free. They like to overcharge & tell blunders like, u need additional copper pipe for the compressor unit & need core cutting for a brick wall..
