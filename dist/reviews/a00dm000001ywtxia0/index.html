   Review Name: Giving tough competition to traditional brands! 
   Review Description: Wanted to buy O' General or Hitachi but since their customer service experience are beyond pathetic decided to choose LG dual inverter AC. I must tell this one is really giving very tough competition to other brands like Voltas, Carrier etc. Cool the room in just 10-15 min from 44 C to 26C. If you are trying to buy an inverter ac and don't want to spend huge chunks on O'General and Mitshubishi Heavy or Daikin etc, try this one.
