   Review Description: Hi All. As i am Mechanical ac engineer i ll tell u how to choose an Ac for your house.
ANY BRAND AC U BUY OFF ANY PRICE LL WORK FINE TILL 6 MONTHS. Wat matters is after 6 months how well ur AC is working Brands like sansui etc etc which s not AC manufacturing brands ll not last more than 6 months u ll face problems later.Choose from ac manufacturer first if u want life.Thn buy according to ur room measurment.Buy 5 star rating or inverter AC for power saving nd good cooling.better choose copper instead aluminum. Check d product review nd video in youtube.compare inbetween selected.do not buy china brands.Finally do not judge any brand ac untill u use for 6 months
