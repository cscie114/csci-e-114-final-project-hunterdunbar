   Review Description: Writing review after 10 days of use.


This AC is enough to cool 200sqft easily and efficiently but if you have bigger space go for 2ton AC. Power saving is good enough to notice. Here are pros and cons -

Pros -

â€¢ It uses very less energy, 10 hours of continuous use @24Â°C will only cost 7-8 units.

â€¢ Cooling is very effective and if your room is below 200sqft area, it will cool it in less than 15mins.

â€¢ Design looks good and Filter is easy to clean.

â€¢ Indoor unit makes no noise at all. Outdoor unit makes little higher noise.

â€¢ Himalaya Cool (HC) option cools down room in just 5min. Which is very good feature.



Cons -

â€¢ Energy Control options (80%, 60%, 40%) even though save energy but they do very slow Cooling.

â€¢ Remote sometimes don't changes the settings if you haven't aimed towards AC properly.

â€¢ LG Service guys were not trained properly, they will be in hurry and they will try to do installation asap, in which sometimes they can harm your device (there are literally hundreds of review with this point and now I know why).

â€¢ AC makes noise for every single change you make, which is very irritating if everyone else is sleeping and you decrease temperature at night.
