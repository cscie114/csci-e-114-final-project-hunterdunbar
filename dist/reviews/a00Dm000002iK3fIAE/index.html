   Review Name: Best in the market! 
   Review Description: Ordered AC on Monday, delivered on wednesday. Same day recived update from LG team that installation ticket is raised and it was installed by next day evening.  Installation was very neat and clean without any hassle. Outdoor unit costs you 850/- which is fair only. Installation charge was 999/-. So overall 1850/-. 
So no issue in installation and ordering.  
Now coming  to cooling  part. Himalyan cool is really excellent. It cools my 144 sq feet room just in 10 mins. AI mode and energy control mode is really awesome.  I have used for maximum 5 hours continuously as its raining now and power consumption was 3 unit.
So energy saver as well. 
Overall its nice product from LG. 
Thanks Flipkart & LG team for prompt delivery and installation though we are in small town.
