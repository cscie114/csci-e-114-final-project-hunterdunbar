   Review Description: Got this AC installed today.. Loved the features and power saving modes. This AC is really a wonderful piece.

The only drawback so far is, with the remote designers. 
I wanna know why there's NO LIGHT in REMOTE?
We can't function remote at night, one needs to switch on the room's light and then operate. This is really sad, I didn't know this demerit before buying. It's very disappointing coming from LG. 
1 less star for this drawback only!!
