   Review Name: Very Good 
   Review Description: Product is good but the man who came for installation was pathetic and damaged wall of my room. It's very disappointing and I am not satisfied with the service provided by LG. However Cooling of AC is excellent. It's too early to say about energy efficiency. LG should review the services.
