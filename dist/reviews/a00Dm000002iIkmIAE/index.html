   Review Name: Nice product 
   Review Description: No doubt in LG brands product they deliver what they promised,A/C Working great and in less than 10 minute room getting  cooled,
Only issue i faced was with LG Installation they are handling it to third part vendor not direct LG executive , they where so rude and unprofessional 
I didn't expect such kind of installation from LG other than that everything is good
4 Star for LG Product
1 Star less for LG Installation
