   Review Name: Could be way better 
   Review Description: 1 am writing review after one year.. here are my opinion about the ac. 
1.) Company free service is worst. They come and just clean the evaporator coil with brush. 
2) 1 st year cooling was  Very good. But after one year cooling reduced to half...  
3) Company did not provide out door unit stand. 
4) company does not provide rubber insulation to cover cooling line which is made of copper.. this line must be insulated otherwise cooling efficiency will reduce.. as heat exchange will be done before indoor unit. And line will sweating.. which is the main cause of point no 2) as per my opinion.
