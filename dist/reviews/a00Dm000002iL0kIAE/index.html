   Review Name: Good 
   Review Description: Though the Ac is fine, installation charges will surprise you.
Installation person will charge for drain pipe, brackets and plug point.
Better buy yourself outside as they charge high amount.
Order the brackets along with the AC.
No need to buy a stabilizer as it is a inverter model.
Installation person will ask to buy one.
If you buy offline installation is free of cost.
