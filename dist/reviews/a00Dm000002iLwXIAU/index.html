   Review Name: Don't waste your money 
   Review Description: Its been three days i have purchased the product but no supportive efforts were made by LG to install it. Rather I made number of calls, mails, raises concerns on flipkart and through Whatsapp but they made no response of it. I purchased many LG products but never seen such cruel behavior towards customers from any of company. I am not aware about product efficiency and it's working till it's installation, but keeping product without any hope of it's installation/demo is much horrible.
