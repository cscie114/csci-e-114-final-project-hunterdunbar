   Review Name: Worth every penny 
   Review Description: Its a good product but I think power consumption is bit on a higher side rest everything looks good for this AC also a noteworthy point about this AC is that it has a bigger indoor unit which means a bigger blower as compared to others which could be a plus point for some due to its air flow while it could be a drawback if you want a compact size indoor unit.
