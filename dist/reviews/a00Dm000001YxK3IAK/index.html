   Review Name: Absolute rubbish! 
   Review Description: AC MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT IT WILL NOT PROVIDE AIRFLOW FOR PEOPLE SITTING ON THE FLOOR JUST BELLOW AC INDOOR UNIT. IT IS HIGHLY OBJECTIONABLE AND PATHETIC AFTER BUYING AC AND NOT GETTING AIR AT DESIRED LOCATION.

PLEASE CHANGE OSCILLATION OF PLATES WHICH DIRECT AIR FLOW LEVEL NEARTEST TO 180 DEGREE SO THAT AIR FLOW CAN BE ENSURED ON THE GROUND ALSO RATHER THAN ON OPPOSITE WALL WHERE NO ONE CAN SITS. 

I WANT TO RETURN JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET MY EXPECTATIONS. 

IF YOU CAN SUGGEST SOME TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS TO PUT AIR DIRECTING FINS DOWN TO THE GROUND LEVEL JUST BELOW AC TO RECTIFY THIS ISSUE, IT MAY BE PROBABLY BEST IN CLASS AC.  YOUR ADVICE WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED. 


It is serious complaint, not an enquiry!

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN THIS ASPECT.
