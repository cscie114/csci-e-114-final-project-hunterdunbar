   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Purchased about 1 month back. Till now very much satisfied with this product. Sufficient for a 150-180 sq ft room. Cooling is very good.
The only problem is the remote does not have a night vision facility. You ll find it difficult in darkness to look for it and to read the display. The AC also makes sounds for every change in settings which disturbs sometimes.
