   Review Description: I had always believed in the brand name of Voltas. And this AC proves how much trustable it is. Its been 2 months since I bought it and the cooling is really good. The room in which it has been fitted feels like a furnace during summer days and it was unbearable to stay in that room previously. But now I just need to turn this machine on and within 15 minutes the room gets cooled enough. At night, anything lesser than 26Â° C will freeze you as that's how efficient this machine is. And the energy bill is also not bad. It is given that a 1.2 ton AC is going to consume huge power but what this latest 5 star rating means is you're going to get this much savings in the long run. The installation was very well done by the technicians sent to me. The remote does not have very high-tech features like WIFI integration but it gets the job done. I had done a thorough research and after considering everything, this was just perfect for me and I highly recommend it.

Hope this helped. Like the review so fellow buyers may get a clearer picture before buying.

P.S.  The installation guys would try to charge you the wrapping cost done by them but it is included in the standard installation charges. So don't get fooled by them as they can charge you 300-500 for it that you are not liable to pay.
