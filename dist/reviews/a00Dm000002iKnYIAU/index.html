   Review Name: Unsatisfactory 
   Review Description: It's the worse product and serviced by Flipkart first I received my AC at the time of installation I got to know that it is bit broken and it's fan is not working its gonna be replaced but after two days on more guy came he open the AC fully and  adjust it but within 4 hours the fan again start making horrible noise I tried to contact the installation company no revert back from last 2 weeks 
One main thing if it's not working you can't complain to voltas coz there is some other company with the name of Jeevas will we the one who install it and take care of your AC
It's better to buy from direct dealers or showrooms coz you have someone in front of you who is accountable for your product not like Flipkart or that unknown company Jeevas
Just to save money I took this wrong step plz we care full
