   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: Review after 5 days of Installation. 
Product is working fine as expected, Below are pros and cons:
1. Cooling in less than 10 minutes(if input voltage is more than 200)
2. No humidity, No odour etc.
3. Remote with 'Night View'

Cons:
1. Design of lower part of indoor units could have been better. 
2. A bit noisy for 5-10 minutes when you turn ON the AC( may be because indoor &Outdoor temperature difference is more)

And at last I want to say 'Installation' is done in very next day of delivery. 
Go for It!!!!!!!!!
