   Review Name: Terrific 
   Review Description: Installation took more than 6 days as town is nearly 45km from nearest service center, Voltas should think about this before delivering AC to my place that it is too far.
Other than that Cooling is perfect ,it cools even at 26Â°  ,looks good and heavy on wall.
AC comes without Wifi feature, No horizontal Swing control through remote, Remote doesn't have lights if you wanna use it in night.
Being an Indian brand perfectly fit into price range.
