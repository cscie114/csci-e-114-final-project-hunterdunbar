   Review Name: Expected a better product 
   Review Description: After using for 10 days I'm writing this review..
First of all Quite disappointed with this purchase, after an extensive research I thought to go with LG 1.5 ton 3star 5 in 1 convertible AC considering its warranty and brand value (compared to other brands it's giving 5 years on pcb) but the main purpose got deviated as it's cooling efficiency is not at all good... Sometimes it seems ok but sometimes it's not cooling as expected... We have a 10/12 room in which 1.5 ton is more than enough but room is not getting cooled effectively even after 30 minutes of usage... The person who are sitting right infront of the ac are only feeling the chill rest of the room is quite normal and not that effective...
And if we turn off the ac within no time the room get warm which is not the case with other(voltas/Daikin) Contacted Flipkart they asked to check with LG brand persons... Will edit the review based on their response...
