   Review Name: Worth the money 
   Review Description: This was first AC purchase and I was expecting a complete product with installation. But to my surprise the product was complete in all respects (Blue Star should take this as feedback).

Missing items-
1. 15 Amp Power Plug
2. 2 AAA batteries for remote 
3. AC Stand
4. Water drainage Pipe length is too short (just 1.5 feet) 
5. The length of pipe to external machine is just 9 feet it barely fits. Although I was lucky, Thanks to service man. 

I am not sure why these minor items were NOT part of package and customer has to buy it additionally at comparatively higher price from Installation agency. 

Additional Suggestions- 
1. Blue star installation charges are high (1800) as compared to other companies (1200). 
2. On top of that missing items were charged separately. 

I am from Pune and for me installation was done by "Air-x" agency and I am happy with installation and workmanship. 

Product Choice:-
1. Think of your usages, I am in Pune and going to use this product for 2 months max hence I went ahead with higher power consumption, low noise and low cost with 3 start rating. I saved money initially.

2. While choosing the product, consideration should be
- Power Consumption
- Coil material (Copper)
- Inverter
- Cooling Capacity
- Noise level
- Protection of Machine from Voltage Fluctuations and weather conditions (blue fin)
- Swing type (2 way/ 4 way) 

Don't go for very fancy products with so many Feature, just look for what you need. No one buys AC at MRP there always a discount of 20k whether you buy it online or at store just visit at right time.
