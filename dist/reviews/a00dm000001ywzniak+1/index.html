   Review Name: Classy product 
   Review Description: Ordered it on 30th May, got delivery on 7th June and was installed on 11th June ( 4days after delivery) , it would have been done even earlier but there was slight bit confusion in communication and location so the delay! This place from where i have booked is not a big city but a town, i was hesitant about installation support by LG but they were bang on and made sure installation was arranged and installation was done neatly, within 1 and half hrs. Coming to product the ac looks elegant and is compact , its so silent when fan speed is kept in lowest you will hardly hear any sound, cooling is also very good! Using it since 9days absolutely no issues!  Installation charges  were 699 (some offer by LG) and installation guy charged additional Rs. 300 to fix the out door stand on wall, which i had bought separately on flipkart) apart from that no extra charges since there was no use of extra copper pipes etc. LG has always been a reliable brand hope ac runs without any issues for long!!

Update : AC i have purchased is 1ton 3star dual inverter
My room size close to 180sqft, thereâ€™s terrace above and pretty hot town temperature goes upto 40degrees plus, inspite of this AC manages to cool the room very quick! 

As of now using AC for close to 6 to 7 hrs ( around 4hrs night and rest day ) will update about electric bill when i get my next bill!

Con : 
1) beep sound while operating remote from indoor unit is irritating, hope there was an option to turn it off! 

2) Will update if thereâ€™s anymore
