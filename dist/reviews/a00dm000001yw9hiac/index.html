   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: Himalaya cooling effect cools very quickly within 5min I noticed.
While himalaya cooling I checked the power consumption was really great 765W. 
Indoor unit works super silent.
Temp range 16C TO 30C. 
Only concern is the quality of plastic material improvement required..
