   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: Voltas - Damn good AC for the 10x10 room , it gets cold in the night so we have to switch it off , trick is to place it above the bed so in peak summer it blows  cool air directly where u sit , otherwise u will have to wait for room to get cold . R32 inverter / silent and good design , easy to install and no hassle long cables with padding which shows quality , all my other ac had cheap padding on external cables , outside is quiet and inside sound  is less than normal fan , modes are same , fan , cool and dry i think , i use cool so not much there and turbo or chill mode that's all. I had voltas earlier water dispenser and it lasted long so hope same here , price is very cheap compared to local stores and it came in 2 days for small city it is good.  Take care of yearly cleaning of ac u will do well.  Split and inverter is way to go , it consumes 1 unit per hr , i would assume i will use some 500 - 770 units in summer for year.
