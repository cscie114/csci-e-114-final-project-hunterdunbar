I had to purchase a new AC for my 200 sqft room. As per many websites a 2 ton would be required to sufficiently cool the room but after some research went with this one anyway and I am glad I did not buy a 2 ton.

Good:
- Faster cooling
- Very silent, shows 35 DB on decibel meter.
- Energy control function can save you up to 60 percent on electricity bills. Hoping to recover bucks paid extra in a year. :)
- 3M filter

Bad:
- Horizontal auto swing which is not available on many top end ACs in the market
Summer performance yet to be evaluated.

Tip: The AC installation contractors only charge me 700â‚¹rs for neat and clean installation
Thank you Flipkart
