   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: I think it is the best product in this price range. It cools my 180 square  feet room in 5 minutes. It's absolutely noiseless. 

The beautiful design has impressed me. 

It was delivered in time and the installation was done within three days. 
I had to pay Rs. 3000 for installation. 

Voltas is a reliable brand and this particular Split AC is the best in the market. Go for it!
