   Review Name: Worthless 
   Review Description: WORST AC, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT 
We purchased the product on 14/6/20 and within just an year of use the ac started to have complaints, and the technician who came for repair informed us that its panel has complaint and for replacement it would cost us 7900 k, we bought the product online from flipkart and he informed us that if we had purchased the item within the district the shops would have provided us additional coverage and the replacement could have been done free of cost, really dissatisfied and disappointed with the quality and service associated with the product, highly recommended not to purchase the product, we use 2 more ac at home one of godrej and other of lloyd for past 4 years and they have never had an issue,
PLEASE DON'T BUY THE PRODUCT, RECOMMEND LG, LLYOD AND GODREJ AS BETTER OPTION
