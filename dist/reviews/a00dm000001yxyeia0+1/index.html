   Review Name: Disappointed with BlueStar service 
   Review Description: FlipKart delivered AC within 2 days after order placement - good service as usual, BlueStar service is below expectation.

1) Installation is done with multiple issues - one of them is, wiring is not taped and vulnerable for shocks.
2) Trained Engineers are required.
3) As committed this AC doesn't come with free installation - engineer will find some way to charge you.

I would not recommend this brand.
