   Review Name: Really Nice 
   Review Description: This is purely the review of installation... product got delivered on the day mentioned promptly ie on a thursday.... great schedule guys.... however when it came to installation it was scheduled on the very next day friday.... no call came through and upon contacting customer care it was mentioned that we hadn't picked up the call. next 2 days we had to be out of station so could not have them installed it so installation was scheduled on the next day ie. monday... still no call from the installation guys and upon contacting customer care even they could provide any satisfactory answer..... only kept on mentioning that the thing had been escalated but no exact date or time was given.... apart from the fact that everything was supposed to be closed up by 4 days from monday..... technician was sent last day of resolution.... worst professional behaviour from first technician assigned.... after complaining other technician was assigned.... on top of that 4000+ installation charges incurred.... installation not proper... looks extremely ugly.... inexperienced technicians sent... made the whole room look very very ugly indeed... destroyed the whole show pf the room...
