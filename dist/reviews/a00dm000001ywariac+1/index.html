   Review Description: Fantastic product this from LG. Very energy efficient. I am using from past 80 days. Its been full hot & rainy season in between. Cool the room within 10-15 mins. I have purchase it when there is no coat emi offer with just 1750/- per month for 2 years. Very pocket friendly offer for us. We are using almost 10-12 hours per day on average basis. I have previously using voltas 5 star rated AC. The energy efficiency is pretty good from this LG DUAL INVERTER TECHNOLOGY AC. I have witnessed 15-20% downwards in our bill comparing from the previous AC which i have used. Just on CONS is after 15-20 days in a high humidity season the water is coming from indoor & outdoor unit. But company has given the solution for that also. A MOISTURE mode which you have to use for 30-40 mins to drain out all the water from both the units. One thing you have to kept in your mind is to clean the AC fliter which is upper side of the AC in every 15-16 days to get the bestest result from this AC. As i have not cleaned for almost 40-45 from the date of installation. It makes a lot difference when you not clean b'coz result will not come as per your expectation. This is common in every AC.
