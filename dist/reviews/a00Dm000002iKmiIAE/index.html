   Review Name: AC is good but Installation experience so worst 
   Review Description: Voltas AC overall very nice. Before I had Samsung AC, now Voltas. From cooling and other aspects it is very nice. Till now it's running very well. Flipkart delivery was excellent too and guys were very nice with their attitude.

But what forced me to put 4 star instead of 5 is very poor Installation process. The guy called me from Jeeves service and were asking to pay around Rs. 2000-2500 to set this machine as they just need to remove my old machine and install new one. He was Bargaining with me so I cancelled it and installed it with my local electrician who took just half of that price. 

Conclusion, AC is good but Installation experience so worst.
