   Review Name: Waste of money! 
   Review Description: It has been 1 week after installing and can say its very poor cooling capacity and efficiency.
Nothing more than a turbo cooler. Complaint about cooling issue but technician told this much only it can cool within its capacity after checking all parameters indicated fine.. 

Dont buy its waste of money.
