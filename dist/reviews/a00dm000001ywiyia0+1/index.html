   Review Description: So its been a week since i have been using this ac.. i will give a detailed review and installation details.

Installation was done on the next day of delivery.
They charged 999 plus 700 for stand and 400 for wrapping. This wrapping charge should be 200 max. I was not at home so couldn't say anything.
They disassembled my old ac for extra 500 bucks which was a tough job as my dad told me. Its was rusty took some time.
The installation process was fine.

Coming to the ac i run the ac only at night for now as I'm out for work all day.
I have a big room. It consumes around 5 units at 40 percent energy saving after using the HC feature for 30 mins which cools the room fast. I keep it on 26 as it gets very cold.. i run it for 8 -9 hours on timer. 
Consumes 5 units. My old ac used to consume 14 units in the same time. This is just one third which is great. Lets see what happens after a season.
