   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: I am writing this after using for a week and I donâ€™t have any reason to complain. I also have another LG 5 Start 1.5 tone and I donâ€™t see much difference. Very much value for money, it works better than expected! It was delivered on time but installation was delayed for 3 days so I get it done from third party. Anyway it cost me the same so I donâ€™t have any issues with installation not done as scheduled. If you have any doubts you can contact me and I can help you with everything you need to know about this AC.
