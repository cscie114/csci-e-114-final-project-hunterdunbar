   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: The product is great. It looks good, it works good. It's compact and silent. This is what was expected of LG.
However this purchase made me go through a sour patch for a little while.
So the delivery guys came on the scheduled date and while getting the compressor down from the carriage they dropped it on the ground. It fell from a height of almost 6-8 feet.
I immediately raised a request for replacement, Flipkart assigned me an engineer to evaluate, it took another 3 days for the engineer to come and he found the product was damaged. Meanwhile I get a call from Ekart executive asking why did I rate the delivery experience as "Bad" citing that there is a 10 day return policy.
I applaud Flipkart for replacing the product though the replacement product was manufactured in 2018 and the damaged one was 2019.
Flipkart needs to train their Ekart people to be more professional with their work rather than being casual and citing "10 day replacement policy" when they break things.
Then again all is well that ends well.
