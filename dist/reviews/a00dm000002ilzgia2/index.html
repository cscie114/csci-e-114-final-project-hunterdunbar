   Review Name: Worth every penny 
   Review Description: Really happy with the performance very less noice and very good cooling I am using this ac on my 120sq ft room and even after using this at 26 degree temperature my room feel like super child. Energy efficiency I haven't check yet but hope so it's work as described. 
Buy this Ac at this price point 37500 seems good but for installation I need to spend 3500 that is too costly installation included outdoor unit stand cost me Rs 550 and 250 per foot for extra copper wire
