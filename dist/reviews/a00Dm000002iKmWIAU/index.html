   Review Name: Classy product 
   Review Description: The product is very good and it's the third AC of same brand and model that I have installed.
this comes with a copper condenser which is better than aluminum .
the air-conditioner is very good and takes 10 minutes to cool a room of approx 180 sq feet.
the build quality is good Voltas service is also good
