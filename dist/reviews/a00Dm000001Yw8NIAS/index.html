   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Delivered in 1 day of placing order. Installation was not so good, the technician made the indoor walls very dirty. Better to warn the technicians before they fit the unit on the walls. 
Machine Pros: Beautiful looking indoor unit. Very subtle design. Cooling is very good. 
Machine cons: Noise, the machine makes more noise compared to other brands what i have in my other rooms. 
Overall, a good buy..
