   Review Name: Good choice 
   Review Description: Product is good and timely delivered, i have ordered this on 28 May 2020 and got delivered on 30 May. Packing was good although the indoor unit have the manufacturing date of January 2020 and outdoor unit label has of November 2019 means manufacturing is recent of my product.

Pros:-
1.) Plastic used in indoor unit is of high quality.
2.) Copper pipe used in both indoor and outdoor unit with both ocean black protection which increase the life span of ac.
3.) Air flow is high enough can go up to 8-10 meters easily in H cool mode
4.) Air filter is on top so no need to open the front flap for cleaning.
5.) Energy savings mode, you can adjust that according to people in room, idly i use in 60% at 26'C for 3 people in room.

Cons:-
1.) Its a myth that it will consume only 2-3 units in 8 hours of usage. It will consume around 6- 7 units if used in power saving mode.
2.) Remote doesn't have back-lid hard to use in night time and you have to aim properly otherwise it wont work sometime.
3.)  Indoor unit is silent but outdoor make noise.(not much )
4.)Installation is costly 

Overall m very satisfied with product and my purchase experience with flip kart its my 4th appliance with flip kart..
