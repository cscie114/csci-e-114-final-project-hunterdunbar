   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: It's one the best AC in this segment, cools room like a pro. It chills the room in no time. Initiwlly installation was not done properly i.e. I was not getting any Cool air from the AC unit, it was working just as Fan. I have contacted the BlueStar customer service and they have sent an another technician who resolved the issue. Happy with this AC.
