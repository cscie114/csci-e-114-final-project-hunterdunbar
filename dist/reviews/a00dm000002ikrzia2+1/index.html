   Review Name: Don't waste your money 
   Review Description: Please do not buy this AC. I am using it on 3rd floor for the last 20 days. Its cooling is worst even on HIGH COOL feature it's not working properly. Even in night it displays the room temperature around 26-27Â° even after 2hrs of running.
I purchased LG as I knew LG offers good products. But I am very disappointed with this product. Now I think it was just a waste of money product.
