   Review Name: Brilliant 
   Review Description: Found it good value for money. Let me summarise the pros and cons

Pros
- Good cooling
- Is convertible which helps in power consumption to 40, 60, 80%
- Less noise compared to other window ACs. I have used many window AC and comparatively it makes much less sound. Ofcourse, we cannot compare it to split AC as there compressor (outer unit) can be installed far from the room.
- Unique design
- Inverter window AC choices are less and we are getting 2022 model at attractive price.

Cons
- If you already have a cutout for standard size of window AC (26inch * 17 inch), then you will have to fill the gaps with foam or something.
