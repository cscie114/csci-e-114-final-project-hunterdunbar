   Review Name: Terrific 
   Review Description: Installation take 2days after delivery and it installed by 3rd party.
I'm writing review after 10 days
Pros:
Cooling was awesome and it cools 140sq mtr within 10-15 minutes
Easy to operate.
Don't know how much electricity consumes by this appliances will share after 1 month. But this is 5 star rating so I'm little happy may be bill will be less.
Sound is negligible

Cons:
Installation cost is too high due to extra pipes, drain waste pipe and wire, it nearly take Rs.6700 for installation. 
All functions of AC are not usable in this price range.


For safety purpose I recommend to use with stabilizer if your area have frequent cut-offs.
