   Review Name: Expected a better product 
   Review Description: Please go for 5 star and 1.5 ton minimum. This AC behaves completely weird. If you put in Auto mode it doesn't cool and if set it to cool mode, it starts cooling but your nostrils will burn. One day we were trying different options and set "I feel" mode. People in the room started feeling dizzy. Skin burning sensation is also there. I don't know why it feels so with this one. And finally power consumption is way too high. Inverter ACs are supposed to be less consuming but this gave a very high bill.

Please don't buy this AC. Go for 5 star one.
