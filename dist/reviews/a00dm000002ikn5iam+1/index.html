   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: awesome product... from LG and very quick and good service from flipkart...I have purchased it after filtering all the ACs in the menu. its sounds less compared to other 1.5 ton ACs, cooling very fast within 5 to 10 mins feeling chillness, dual inverter, no need of stabilizer. LG installation service people are very good. Only cons are its swing is not horizantol and remote is not having night vision light to operate the remote. for checking electricity consumption waiting for EC bill...
