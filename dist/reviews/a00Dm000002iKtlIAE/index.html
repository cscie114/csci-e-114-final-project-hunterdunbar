   Review Name: Worth the money 
   Review Description: I have a similar one at my parents home. so I bought it for 22k . seems a good bargain . I was busy with my job so I was not able to get it installed. Now it's lying idle still packed new. I guess I will use it in May 2019. Good Ac overall at this price.
