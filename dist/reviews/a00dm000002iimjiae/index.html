   Review Name: Nice 
   Review Description: Cooling is decent but Most premium AC in LG range and still doesn't have following features which are available in normal AC -
1. Air Swing not available. So you have air throw in one direction only.
2. Remote neither have backlight nor have radium button, so you keep on guessing buttons and display in night.
3. Doesn't have any option of fresh air intake, so only room air recirculate
