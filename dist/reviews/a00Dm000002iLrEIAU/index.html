   Review Name: Highly recommended 
   Review Description: Got my new AC through flipkart. I preferred voltas for installation not jeeves as they costs me more. Installation done by Voltas technicians was good. After 1 month of usage, AC cools my 11*13 room with in 2 to 4 minutes. Less outdoor unit noise. Haven't checked the power consumption hope it will be lesser than non inverter ac's. Remote doesn't have light it can be managed. overall good product.
