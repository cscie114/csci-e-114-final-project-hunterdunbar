   Review Name: Fabulous! 
   Review Description: Nice AC. Heard some negative reviews pertaining to installations and sound it makes, remote size, etc. Well first of all its a budget friendly ac ,buyer may wait for any sale which flipkart launches time to time for a pocket friendly price. Secondly it doesnt make any sound while functioning. There may be a slight problem with its swing as it may make sound while swing is on. For this just refix the front panel which includes the filter. If the problem remains try to call service guys of tata they will do it. Installation varies from the kind of person visiting your place mostly these are unprofessional and employed just to fill the numbers keep a surveillance at the time of installation, if you are unsatisfied complain to tata customer centre directly. There are some fixed charges for installation which must be confirmed beforehand from customer care or from tata website. If the installing guy overcharges complain to customer care , if you are suspicious of installation process then have a recording of whole process. Sign the installation only after being satisfied. Thirdly remote is slightly big but good. Don't install by yourself as warranty may get void and further dont install by yourself when you dont have stabiliser and have voltage issues. Carpenter work, removal of old ac can be done from outside (no warranty issues). Overall its a good product for budget under 25k. Only thing is that their contractual employees like these installation guys needs more training ,expertise, and conversational training.
