   Review Name: Don't waste your money 
   Review Description: The AC needs repairing every other day despite being used for only 3-4 times. Brand value is only for namesake. The products of voltas will cause you headache. Also the customer service is extremely slow. I would have rated it zero if there was any option. Go for other brand if you wish to buy an AC that doesn't need cause you trouble. Disappointing and pathetic experience..
