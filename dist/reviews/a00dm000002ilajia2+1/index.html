   Review Name: Decent product 
   Review Description: 1. Swing is not completely downward.. It swings from top to 45 degrees.. so if ac is placed above bed head, air flows thru only legs

2. Remote features and modes are not too good.. unfunctional keys doesn't feel good to be in a remote.. 

3. Design is not satisfactory compared to other models 

4. Room feels humid after turning on AC for few hours

5. Price is average in the segment, not too high and not too low.

6. 7 hours of AC consumed 11 units of power.
