   Review Name: Fabulous! 
   Review Description: Super. But i recommended to new purchaser not used technician's wall stand, because its cost charged Rs 850 and quality also very bad. Purchase from market only in Rs 350 and best quality. I have installed technician's wall stand and found very bad fitting, then i complain to LG via mobile app and got very soon response. Later same technician came and re-installed with may purchase stand and fitting very good.
