   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Product is good  but while Flipkart after discount price is shown as 27,500/-, the MRP printed on packing box is 23,500/-! So is it a genuine discount or a rip off?  Better check the price directly with Blue Star office before buying. Also the unit which was deliverd to me carried a manufacturing date more than a year old. If its lying in stock for more than a year, what's wrong with it? Maybe a longer period usage will tell me. 
The installation is free as per Flipkart. But when fitting men come, they first insist it is not free. After lot of arguments and them acting as if they are cheking with their office, they agree it is free but after installation, will claim substantial amount as extra charge for white tape or rubber base bushing or something like that. I had to pay finally Rs 600/- as didnt want to continue the fight. So before installation , make everything clear that there should be no charge asked after installation.
