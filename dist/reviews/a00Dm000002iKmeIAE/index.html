   Review Name: Fits the bill and serve the purpose! 
   Review Description: Product should get 5 star, did its job perfectly. The remote accompanied is universal Tata remote which have extra features for may be split ac but does it work fine. Its not totally silent its loudness unit is 73 db, average indian silent home have 45 db. So choose accordingly , for me it is fine and fits my bill and purpose. 
A word about flipkart as platform, I initially booked the same ac from different platform, it took 7 days to deliver to me, however after 4th day the shipment was lost in transit and after 10 days I cancelled the order and ordered it on flipkart and received the product within 1 day.
