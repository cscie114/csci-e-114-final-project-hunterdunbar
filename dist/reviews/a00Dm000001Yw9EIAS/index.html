   Review Name: Just wow! 
   Review Description: This is my 4th unit purchased. I'm happy with the product. Very very silent, even whiter than a ceiling fan.
I have installed it in 14x15 room top floor in Delhi and it working good. If you looking for chilling room than go for 1.5 ton. I prefer for cool room and not feel to be sitting in a refrigerator..
