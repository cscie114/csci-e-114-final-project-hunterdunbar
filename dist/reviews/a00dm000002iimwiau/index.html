   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Today is second day so I cant give you much details. Design and cooling is good. Cons- When you ON the AC it starts on power saver mode so every time you need to change to Normal mode and it doesnt have auto swing. Flipkart delivery system was smooth but LG installation was pathetic I have burnt my blood for continous 7 days follow up and finaly when they arrive, installation person came and just hang the AC on window. There was no.proper installation no window setup no. To filled the gap they use thermacol :). 
So right now m satisfied with look and feel and features. How efficient it is only time will tell.
