   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: Nice product by LG 
Installation was okay 
It costed me lot of money as I had to fix the outdoor unit approx 12-13 ft away 
Energy consumption is still unknown as AC is installed just yesterday. 
But feature and technology wise, best product
I preferred LG over Diakin only for Dual inverter technology. Otherwise price of AC was same. 
Just I am disappointed due to expensive installation
