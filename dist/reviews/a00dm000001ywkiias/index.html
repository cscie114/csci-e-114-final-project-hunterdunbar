   Review Name: Waste of money! 
   Review Description: Flipkart ... pay head to calls made to your customer care officials again and again, no one is getting the Installation of LG ac that I bought and it is lying out side for past 6 days idling. If services can't be rendered on time then please do not claim on your portal for the same. Extremely tired of such boring assurance and numerous sorry with new time from your Flipkart customer care team... horrendous experience !
and no one is getting it sorted n resolved... product delivered n Flipkart work is over!! now customers please go ahead n break your heads with LG !! Sad !
