   Review Name: Useless product 
   Review Description: Regretting buying a Voltas AC. Stopped cooling in six months. Technician said it is gas leakage issue which he filled up. Again i faced same issue after two months, technician again said same thing and filled up gas. Now after one month, same problem I am facing, but due to lockdown I am unable to get it repaired. Also warranty is going to exhaust. Pathetic products by Voltas.
