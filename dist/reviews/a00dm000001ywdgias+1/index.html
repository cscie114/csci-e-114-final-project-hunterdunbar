   Review Name: Nice product 
   Review Description: The received product is good so far. The indoor unit is quiet enough , but outdoor unit can get loud at times.  The cooling is nice and fast. Remote could be made more intuitive. If you are very noise sensitive , keep the outdoor unit away from your sleeping point. LG should improve their electronics and give WIFI for all this range of models. The fixing process was poor.  No vacuum pump used before releasing gas. Even a small amount of trapped air is harmful for the refrigeration system. Even after requesting it , they did not do this step.
