   Review Name: Worth the money 
   Review Description: I am submitting after one month. Having no problem. Sounds little bit, Consume one unit per hour, big in size, installation charges extra for ply wood (very thin). I used thick ply wood which charges me more. Requires stabiliser so those who thinks to buy also buy stabiliser.
