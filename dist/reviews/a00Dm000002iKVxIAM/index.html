   Review Name: Best in the market! 
   Review Description: I waited for one month to understand all apsects. All promised features are working and delivery was good (considering the delivery address to be a remote area in at eastern india). Product is good. For new buyers in doubt, let me tell you I was experiencing the same fear whether to trust ecommerce for high value home appliances or not. Also during my time the average rating was below 2 amd only one negative review was there. No positive review. But I recieved a good one and thanks to flipkart for the discount.
