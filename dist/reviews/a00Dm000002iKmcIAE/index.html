   Review Name: Nice product 
   Review Description: Good AC in affordable price. But, it's cooling capacity is lower (may be its nature) than other brands like LG 1.5 Ton AC. It doesn't cool fast and cooling does not stay for long after it is turned off. But, cooling is comfortable when it is running. One can go for it as it is pocket-friendly and from a renowned brand. Design is also sophisticated. Flipkart Delivery and Voltas installation is good.
