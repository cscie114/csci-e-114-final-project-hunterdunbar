   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: best features are

- Himalayan Cool mode, extra cooling with very high speed of blower for 30 minutes

- Energy control mode. being inverter AC, it has energy control mode as 80%, 60%, 40% loading of temperature selected.

- other common features as sleep, timer etc are good.

- deflecter plate angle can be adjusted to different angles which we can do for two angles only in other ACs

- light off feature available

- room temp can be monitored in remote

Cons:

- Automatic cleaning not available

- air filter screen given on the top, so we have to reach at the top of AC (which is quite difficult) to remove the screen for cleaning, while in other ACs , we can open the lid and remove the screen.
