   Review Name: Worthless 
   Review Description: the AC was delivered on July 29th and installed in August. I have barely used it for a few times and since last few days, water is trickling from the indoor unit and I cannot use the AC. I am going to take up the matter with LG customer care but it is very shocking that such a problem would arise within just 2 months of buying an AC of a renowned brand like LG.
