   Review Description: Ac should have faster cooling .....and Lg dont provide it... it cools the room but a little slow. all things are good very good design , functions,  very good build quality ....but cooling is slower than other acs....air throw is very less( thats why it is silent ) . I dont recommend this because it is a not a cost effective product. it doesn't repay.....go for a cheaper ac and use it for 5 to 7 years and then  replace it.
