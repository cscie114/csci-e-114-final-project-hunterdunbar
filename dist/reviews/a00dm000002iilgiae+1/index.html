   Review Name: Energy Efficient & Well Designed 1.5 Ton Window AC 
   Review Description: For the AC (JW-Q18WUXA1, 3-Star variant):

PROS:
1.cooling is good not the best. i live on top floor & my floor is exposed to sunlight from all four sides. i use it at 25 or 27 degree, Still this ac cools the house efficiently but if u r someone who uses the ac at 21 or less & want chill like feeling, go for the 5-star variant (may be that gives the chilling effect) bcoz it is not good for that much cooling or purchase it if you live on the floor that is not exposed to sunlight.
2.it is also very energy efficient. As it is an inverter AC, it changes the load according to the need. If used wisely it will surely save money bcoz its power consumption stands at 1660W(1800W Max.).
3. it also has an energy saver mode which is very useful.

CONS:
1. no auto swing function
2. you cant see the buttons on remote when it is dark. no backlight on remote buttons.
3. noise level is ok at low or medium fan speed but it is a bit high at high fan speed (sometimes irritates but very much bearable)
4. no auto fan speed control, you have to manually set it.

CONCLUSION:
most important thing in an ac is its cooling which is good & its electricity consumption and here it excels but it is also has above mentioned cons which sometimes irritates, and also rated cooling capacity is 4700W which is also on lower side, at 42kg it is lighter & compact than most 1.5 Ton ACs available in the market, it might means that company has made compromises on some internals. so, finally it seems good in initial usage but i have doubt on long term durability.

INSTALLATION:
it was not installed on stated date. i had to make several calls and boil my blood for 5 days after which it was installed. so, for installation i will give zero. so, when u purchase it, be ready to wait for 5-7 days for installation. and i think late installation was might be bcoz of current lockdown, but still lg is a reputed brand so they should have taken care of that.

FLIPKART:
flipkart or seller has made a single page for the 3-star variant (JW-Q18WUXA1) & 5-Star variant (JW-Q18WUZA), which is misleading. As a result,  the reviews of the 3-Star & 5-Star variant are combined, so when a user writes review for 5-star variant it automatically becomes the review for the 3-star variant which is misleading. definitely the 5-star variant has a better performance than this one so a review written for 5-star variant is not applicable for the 3-star variant which is also cheaper. So, I request flipkart to fix this so that the customer doesnt get fooled by the reviews of the 5-star variant & can make a better choice by reading the actual review of the 3-star variant.

EDIT 1(After using it for almost 2 months):
now i have been using this ac for well more than a month & now this is what i have to say:
1. cooling is decent not the best bcoz its cooling capacity is 4700W, still it manages to cool atleast 2 adjacent rooms(16*13.5 ft = 200 sq ft each room) in my house efficiently even at a temperature of 27 degree when outside temperature is around 44-45 degree(top floor)(delhi). At night, when it has to cool a single room with 3 occupants, it does the job perfectly. Still i think if it had the cooling capacity of 5000W or more, it could have done better.
2. for electricity consumption i would like to say if you use it wisely it will save you a lot on your electricity bill, to make the most use of inverter technology you need to use it wisely. Use it at slightly higher temp like 25 or more bcoz when you do this the ac would have to work lesser to reach that temp and as soon as it reaches the temp or about to reach it, it will decrease the electricity consumption and save you some bill, but when you set it at say 21 or even less, practically the ac will never be able to reach that temp (in my case) and will consume electricity like an normal Ac and you will get a hefty bill.
Let me give you my example, my sister and i have the same ac (obviously different houses) but she uses her AC around 21 & i use it at 26 or 27, she got an electricity bill of 6000 but my electricity bill was of 3500 when we use it for almost 24 hrs daily.
There is also more electricity consumption when you have to cool a larger area. if u want to cool a single room or smaller area then the electricity consumption will be less (As i do during night when i have to cool down a single room), it only consumes 3 or 4 units for 9 hrs when used at 27, even during the day if you have to cool a single room the energy consumption will be less, but if you have to cool a larger area (like i do during the day when i have cool 3 adjacent rooms of area 200 sq ft. each) my consumption stand at 1.2-1.5 units per hour. So, what amount of bill you get completely depends on your way of using it.
I suggest u to always go for an inverter ac whether it is window or split, believe me it will always save you some money if you are a heavy user like me.
