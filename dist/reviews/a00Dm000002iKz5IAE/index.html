   Review Name: Decent product 
   Review Description: Product is good, it has little noise  that is understandable due to join compressor. Another review will give after 1 month of usage

However authorized person for demonstration and installation who should come,  sent some carpenter to install AC. They did installation but they had no knowledge of AC and showing me the name of remote button,  "I ask them more in detail the say that is it to switch On and off the button". And the demonstrated person who should come to explain the features he simply says on phone what demonstration do you need. It is on and off button, plus minus button, bla bla bla..... 

Like we are fool who don't understand anything and purchased such product online. 

Flipkart name is branded but such hired demonstrated people will make there name into garbage soon.
