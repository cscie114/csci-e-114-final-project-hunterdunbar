   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: I have been using this since last 8 months and I am pretty much satisfied with this Voltas product.my room size is 150 sq feet if I run it in normal mode it takes 10 min to cool the room .if I put in on turbo mode it takes just 5 to 6 min to cool the room so overall the cooling is very good.really nice product specially this model.i would like to recommend everyone for buying this ac if you are looking for 1.5 ton ac.i must say donâ€™t go for inverter ac because thatâ€™s more expensive and maintenance cost is also higher than non inverter ac.i am not saying inverter technology is not good it is very good now a days but if you are someone who can effort the cost then go for it or else if you are someone who is looking for non inverter ac so specially this model is most recommend .go for it without any second thought ðŸ‘
