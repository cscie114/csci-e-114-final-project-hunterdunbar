   Review Name: Not original Voltas Product, marketed one. Bad installation. 
   Review Description: The product was delivered well in time by Flipkart, but installation support by Voltas limited is very bad, in Chennai. Had to buy this despite several bad experiences as other a.c.'s (LG, Blue Star, Carrier, Onida, Hitachi) are not available in Flipkart site. The product itself from the carton box does not appear to have been manufactured by Voltas, but an unit manufactured by a Delhi based company (Zamil Airconditioners India Pvt Ltd) and is marketed by Voltas. I wonder, what is the assurance on quality.
