   Review Name: Worst experience ever! 
   Review Description: Average product . Cooling is not fast. Gas got leaked within 2 months. It is not cooling the room. LG technical support team is very slow and it is very hard to follow up with them. Installation was not easy as LG took long time for installation and done by trainees. Worst technical staff and support by LG. Very poor product service by LG.
