   Review Description: flipkart service is good I received this ac  2 days before schedule. first time it was making too much noise I called customer care they fixed it very next day . after few days it started making noise again I have to called customer care of voltas again they repaired it next day.  the service guy told me all the bolts of ac was loose that's why my its making too much noise. Now it working smoothly so less sound value for money and service of Volta's is good.
