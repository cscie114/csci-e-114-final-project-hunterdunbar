   Review Name: Highly recommended 
   Review Description: Excellent A.C

Cooling is very good.
Cools my 125 sq feet room in 10 minutes.
ODU is very silent.
IDU is silent as well but a bit of fan noise can be heard in turbo mode but that should be ok.
Remote is bulky.
Highly energy efficient. My 5 KV voltage stabilizer easily handles the A.C load along with other running devices in my home.
Installation charges are higher by Voltas team. They said that around 1300 rs will be the standard installation charges + GST extra (nice scam in the name of gst). Anyway I got it installed by a third party in just 1100 rs. 
Go for it, it is a budget friendly ac having inverter technology and with iseer rating 3.80.
