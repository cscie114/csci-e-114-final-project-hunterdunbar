   Review Name: Does the job 
   Review Description: Up to 3rd year it worked well, but in the 4th year it became worthless. The coil developed leakage and the company's engineer says that it needed to change for making it work properly. If you are ready to spend Rs. 13000 as estimate given by company's engineer then go for Blue Star AC.
