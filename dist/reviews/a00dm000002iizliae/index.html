   Review Description: This is one of the best AC considering the design, functions, noice level, comfortable.. can say a all-rounder AC.. no noice at sleep mode. Very minimal sound of fan at high speed.. I would recommend to keep the fan speed at auto mode so smooth functioning. I feel features gives that Extra cooling to you any where in the room
