   Review Name: Worth every penny 
   Review Description: Product is obviously awesome. You can go for it. 

But not happy with Flipkart service. For installation LG is charging only Rs. 499. But Flipkart charge is Rs. 1500 to 2000.

Otherwise the product is nice. Really soundless operation. Dual inverter consuming low electricity. Quick cooling option. Best for room size 12x14ft.  Body colour looking very cool. Copper tube is good. If you pay little amount LG provides double insulation coating. No stabilizer required.
