   Review Name: Terrible product 
   Review Description: I am using it from 1 week in expectation today it'll make room cool. I would have given it 0 star if option is available. I swear don't buy it. It is functioning like a cooler, only giving cool air in front of it not maintaining the room temperature. Even It's manager tried to deceive me by saying it'll maintain 25C-26C if I put it on 16C. Now think about what happen if you set 25C. It also don't have radium in it's remote button neither light in remote display so it's making impossible to change it's function in night also making so much noise even on fan lowest speed. Very Very bad experience with this AC. Feel like I have wasted my 30K from my saving. Very Very disappointed with this. I want my money back at any cost. Unfortunately this item falls under only replacement category and It got installed after it's replacement policy got over. I request to the flipkart please enable return policy also on these kind of product. Never expected this kind of cheap product and cheap service from Company like LG. Need Help from LG.
