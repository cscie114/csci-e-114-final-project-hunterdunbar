   Review Name: Excellent 
   Review Description: I am writing this review after usage of one week, thanks for LG and flipkart delivery the product as mentioned. 

1. Cooling is superb
2. Noise is very less
3. As it is 5 star, power saving is also good.

It tooks 30-45 mins to make room as cool.

Everything is good, only one thing which I feel bad is installation. Technication has good knowledge on product but he charged 1500/- for installation.

It is good if installation charges are make less.
