   Review Name: Very Good 
   Review Description: Nice Product,
Gives faster cooling. Cools my 200sqft hall in just 10mins. Build Quality is Good. Not yet tested in energy consumption but sure it consumes less energy. When it comes to noise, it is silent in low speed but at medium and high speed the fan is a bit noisy. Remote menu is simple. Satisfied with the performance and the product..
