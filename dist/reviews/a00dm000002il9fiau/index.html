   Review Name: Does the job 
   Review Description: Installation: 4 star,it was smooth as the guys sent were very generous
Product Working: 2.5 star,After installation, it worked well for 1 day then it cooling stopped , called installation guys again and then it took 2 more visits form them to rectify the issue which was gas leakage. I was shocked how come a new product comes with these type of issues.
Product features: 3.5 star,It doesnt support horizontal fan though the option is present in the remote control. Also its been 1 month now but the temp goes min to 22 till now after running it for 4 hrs.
