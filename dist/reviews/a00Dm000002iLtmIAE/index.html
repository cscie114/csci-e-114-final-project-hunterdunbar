   Review Name: Just wow! 
   Review Description: Review for 0.75 Ton 3 Star
Pros: Very good for 10x10x10 room
AC cools room nicely as desired, but keep in mind a few things. The set temperature is only displayed on AC panel for few seconds, then it switches to temperature senses by sensor in remote which entirely depends on location and position of remote. Yes the AC actually chills, upto 17-18 degree Celsius but the displayed room temperature might show just 24 or 25 because the temperature sensor in remote is on downside, so room temperature appears more, u can easily feel chilled room.
Tips: 
1. Make sure room is well insulated for ac to be efficient.
2. Dont believe on temperature shown at panel of AC.
3. Keep on Cool Mode at 24 with fan speed at med or turbo & Keep ceiling fan on at medium speed.
4. Take a chaddar or a thin blanket because you will need it in after 1 hour (trust me).
5. It has outdoor air vent, use it if u want outdoor air in the room. (Low cooling)
6. If humidity is high, dont use dry mode, it will make air so dry, instead keep on using cool mode, it will remove enough humidity make you feel comfortable.
7. Remote sensor is not good, due to which panel shows high temperature then actual.
8. Remote has input lag of 1 seconds.
9. Keep panel display off and it will show temperature it goes down.

Again: Don't believe on panel room temperature. It will show high even if it's 20 degrees.
