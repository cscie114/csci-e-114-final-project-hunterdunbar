   Review Name: Hated it! 
   Review Description: water leaking after one week. cooling is not extraordinary, but its pretty good. cools my 10x10 room in 5-6min at night, and 10-15 min at noon when its 39Â°-40Â° outside.if you have higher budget go for something higher. it does not have auto horizontal swing but most of them dont. (you have to manually shift the swingers at a particular horizontal position).


edit: MY AC IS BROKEN AFTER 2WEEKS. WATER LEAKING. MY WALL HAS DAMPENED. THEY WON'T PAY ME EXTRA TO REDO MY WALL. VOLTAS IS UNRESPONSIVE. SO IS FLIPKART. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.
