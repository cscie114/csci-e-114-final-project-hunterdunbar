   Review Name: Did not meet expectations 
   Review Description: Writing this review after 05 days of intensive usage. Cooling is pathetic , takes more than 30 mins to cool in room size of 12Ã—10. Aesthetics and no sound are only pros in this AC. Dissatisfied with my purchase. Would recommend Failing and Samsung above this . 
Lost faith in LG refrigeration brand .
