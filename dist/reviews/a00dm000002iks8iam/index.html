   Review Name: Brilliant 
   Review Description: This AC I purchased recently delights me since the installation completed last week. The cooling is good and it makes less noise only while in operation.
I am fortunate enough to have a good service personnel for installation as I found in the review of others with most of them having irking experience.
Everything went smooth and I hope it will continue to work fine in the times to come. I still have a small fear about my choice of preferring LG make omitting the popular "O GENERAL" product which is priced at very high.  
Overall, I am happy and I will recommend this model to others.
Time will answer whether I'm right or wrong.
