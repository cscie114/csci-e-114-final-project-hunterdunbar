   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: I was skeptical about the purchase after seeing many negative reviews but decided to go for it over other options. So far, itâ€™s an excellent product and energy efficient. The only con is no light in remote control for such an expensive ac. Cooling, design, installation everything was smooth on next day itself. Timely delivery as per promise.
