   Review Name: Perfect product! 
   Review Description: AC is fantastic, can cool up a room up to 180sq ft. easily. it is the LG best and cheap 5 * model. Rest models coming with 4 way cooling and wifi are useless and not worth spending more money.

I purchased Outdoor AC bracket (stand) from the market at Rs350 only.

LG installation is Rs999 but there is a catch, they will charge you another Rs250 for fitting outdoor bracket which is nowhere mentioned on LG or Flipkart site.

I purchase AC for Rs 35000 only which is a great deal. Rest accessories like wire(Extra 6m wire for Rs 300), top plug (Rs 40), stand (Rs 350), drain pipe (Rs 150 for 5m), all purchased from outside as LG technicians charge a hefty amount for this.
