   Review Name: Very improper coordination 
   Review Description: My ac installation got delayed because on improper punctuation in the content writting and no coordination between FK and Jeevas.. because Jeevas assign inreturn to some 3rd party asking extra charges for items already included in standard installation.. voltas ac is good but FK can surely improve a lot on tieups with service provider.
