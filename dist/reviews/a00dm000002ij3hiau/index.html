   Review Name: Really Nice 
   Review Description: It's been more than week since I'm using this to be honest design & cooling is perfect but this not silent at all and i think it make noise more than others(this is what i feel) and didn't liked the packaging it was not that safe it should be protected with thermal foam every side.. Overall ac performance is great.
Update after almost 4month of use: It's not that silent at all! And i feel its differ in cooling from other ACs (bit low room cooling) but yeah if the person is standing infront of the AC then it will freeze you but this kinda feel like a cooler experience if we have to sit infront of the ACðŸ˜‚
