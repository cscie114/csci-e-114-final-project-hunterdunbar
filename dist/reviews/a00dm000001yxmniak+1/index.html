   Review Description: all the videos on YouTube is fake about power consumption ..they show it consume 300 W after  reaching set temperature ...they show it consume 2to3 units  in 8 hours at temperature 26. I have purchased because of that videos on YouTube .but in actual life .1.5 ton 5 star consume 1 unit per hour .means 8 unit in 8 hours in 40% energy saving mode .rest every thing is good . cooling is awesome .never feel to use the Himalayan mode ..
