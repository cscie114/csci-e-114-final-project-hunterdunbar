   Review Name: LG - Worst AC Installation 
   Review Description: Flipkart AC Installation Technician: AC Installation Guy came before Installation date, that sounds good. But he made worst Installation, drilled three time to correct AC Position in Center. When I ask them pull the pipe on roof from side of the wall. He said that he cannot do that. Even extra holes on wall, ask them, who will fill the hole on wall, guy said that not part of installation..
