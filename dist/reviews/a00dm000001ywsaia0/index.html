   Review Name: Worth the money 
   Review Description: product is very good. It is less in length than any other 1.5 ton Ac. I was surprised when I first saw this. I thought Flipkart sent me 1 ton AC. But it is 1.5 ton is what installation guy said. It's a new design. No demo has been provided. The installation guy just installed the product took 1450 rs. and left. No demo, no explanation of the features. I am just learning about the function from user Manual. I don't think the installation guy was am LG professional. He was a third party contractor. Not impressed that after spending 40K on AC, it was handled as if someone just fit a ceiling fan. Giving 4 stars for only the product. Flipkart's role has not been very satisfactory either.
