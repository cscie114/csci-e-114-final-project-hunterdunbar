   Review Name: Delightful 
   Review Description: Just 15 days back,  I got it from Flipkart. Prompt Delivery. Next Day Installation was there. Installation people were  directly from Voltas.

Good workmanship. Separately paid 1179 for installation. Since  I purchased extra copper pipe and sleeve covers, they charged extra 250/MTR  as labour charge.

I am yet to find out the energy efficiency after a month usage . I will give more reviews on all parameters later. 

So far so good..
