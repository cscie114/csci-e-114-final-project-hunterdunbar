   Review Name: Excellent 
   Review Description: Great product! I have an 11x11.5 room and the AC cools it nicely even in energy saver mode. keeps it cool and the cooling is lasting.

you cannot expect it to cool in instant and make it snowy but it cools more than satisfactory for a room size equal to mine. in a smaller one, it'll cool even bette.

I am reading bad reviews about Voltas installation service but my AC was delivered at 12PM and by 6PM the AC was installed. the installers were quick and knew their work.

my experience was great!.
