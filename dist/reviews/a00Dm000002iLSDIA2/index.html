   Review Name: Did not meet expectations 
   Review Description: The seller is poor, sales wrong product we have raised the complaint to the Voltas service centre for 12 times since we purchased this AC 7 months ago, it makes a lots of noice, water comes from any side. We are not satisfied with the product while we have same product purchased offline last year and that is working fine. So here is seller send the wrong product. Also see how many times we raised the complaint but now we come to flipkart in a hope they will look to this but it seems they also not help us. So never purchased high amount items online.
