   Review Name: Worth the money 
   Review Description: As of now product is good. Let's wait for energy efficiency.  Taking about installation services, it was pathetic.  The person who visited for installation did everything as per his will and choice even after me insisting on wat I wanted. He ruined all the good experience and joy for the ac that I bought. He gave me a confirmation that he would get me a ring to cover the unevenness created on wall.  But still I haven't received it.  Product is good at a good price but installation service has given a bad experience.
