   Review Name: Classy product 
   Review Description: Installed a week earlier. Working as advertised. We have installed it in our hall which is approximately 24 * 12 feet (288 sq feet). Cooling is adequate and very comfortable. Overall, good product and worth the money. Can't comment on the electricity usage yet.
