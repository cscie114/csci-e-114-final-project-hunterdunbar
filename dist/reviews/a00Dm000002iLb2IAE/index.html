   Review Name: Brilliant 
   Review Description: Product is good but Installation wasn't professional. Drilled a hole but dint close the hole.
And technician charged me  Rs.1000 for wall stand. 
The same wall stand Carrier technician gave for Rs. 750 during Carrier AC installation on the same day of LG installation.
