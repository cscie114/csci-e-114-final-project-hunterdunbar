   Review Name: Good AC 
   Review Description: Another good product from LG.

1. Fast cooling  - 10 minutes to cool medium size room.
2.  (indoor unit) Awesome noise control - barely you hear noise even if you set fan speed  high.
3. Need more air flow for long range. Swing is good enough for small room but not good medium size room.
4. Normal AC stabilizer is more than enough.
5. Good features, less power consumption - go for it if you are usage is more than 7 hrs a day.

Overall it's good.

After 6 month usage

Flipkart needs to give more information guide about installation and charges.
