   Review Name: Don't waste your money 
   Review Description: LG Ac installation is an issue. First of all they took 1 week to contact us for installation. After 1 week they send inexperienced  technisians to install Ac. Plus they were rude and the superviser was rude too when he talked to us about the issue about installation via phone. We are not buying anything else from LG.  Customer support sucks.ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»
