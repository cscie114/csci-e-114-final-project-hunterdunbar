   Review Name: Excellent 
   Review Description: One of the best AC from LG.
It has loaded with more affordable features like auto restart, sleep mode, switching of indoor display light from remote itself along with healthy R32 refrigerant & self diagnosis app to check for any error issues.
An instant cooling effect of inverter technology dual rotary compressor.
It has anti bacterial filter along with dust filter.

Nice remote control with himalaya cool button for instant cooling, more swing options for positioning louvers air cool in right direction.

It comes with all copper (hi grooved) pipes, 100% copper condenser coil with 5 star rating & very low noise level below 26 db(decibels).

But no deodorising filter, heating option of air during winter & no heating option.
I have added stabilizer for additional safety even brand recommends stabilizer free function.
But standard installation charges of 1600 to be paid extra.
I opted for 3 inch dia core drilling of walls (1000 extra) for clean fitting & installation, instead of free regular hand drillinig of holes multiple times to make it larger & ugly that will make walls lot of stains.
Overall satisfied with LG brand & service.
