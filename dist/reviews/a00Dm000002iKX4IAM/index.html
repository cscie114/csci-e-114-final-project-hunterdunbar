   Review Name: Fabulous! 
   Review Description: LG installation service created havoc. They aren't professionals and overcharge you.They haven't installed properly .The LG customer care isn't taking complaint against their installation personnel saying that no such grievance redressal system exists with LG. Bad customer service from LG (not from my city.The customer care denied taking complaint from me ).Overall YOU CAN SKIP BUYING FROM 'LG' because even if the product is good , what you need is after sales service.
