   Review Name: Terrific 
   Review Description: I am happy with this ac. Recently i bought this from Flipkart. iDU design is good.. very effective cooling it cools 130sq feet room within 5mins. This ac work well in dehumidifier mode.
Delivery is ok, but take 3 days to install the ac. Secondly installation charge is high as compared to other brand ac...so Voltas has to look into this. 

Finally function wise it is best ac ...
