   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: Value for money. Got apr 2019 model. New one.
Remote is universal voltas remote, so all buttons wont work as feature not available in this AC.
Horizontal swing and wifi not available.

AC installation charges are high. Core cutting market rate is 90 rs per inch but they will ask 150 rs per inch.
Drainage pipe comes at 20 rs meter in market but they charge 25 rs per foot.
Very young age guys (18-20 year age) and around 40 kg self weight person came for installation. Hence outdoor unit was installed at lower hight. 
They charge 1599 as installation charges and everything else is extra.

Installation guys should be professional which was missing in this case. They are trained technically but miss lot of small things so you have to guide and remind them.

AC quality is very good. Flipkart delivery On time. Installation not excellent. Hence 4 star.
