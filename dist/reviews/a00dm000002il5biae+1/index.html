   Review Name: Value-for-money 
   Review Description: The product is excellent. Tata product as usual. The installation team is worst, they have demanded high amount of money without any justification. Hence, the installation has been completed by myself. The higher authority of TATA company must look into the matter to keep the Company's image in the present competitive market.  DR. P. K. PAL
