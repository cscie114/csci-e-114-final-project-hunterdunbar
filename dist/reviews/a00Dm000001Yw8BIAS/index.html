   Review Name: Overall, Satisfied with the Product, Cooling is good. 
   Review Description: Better Price was available at Shops in Market, Also, Vertical Swing button feature does not work in this AC but button is provided on Remote.
Cooling is good but if you have room area more than 120 Sq feet go for 1.5 ton AC..
