   Review Name: Not recommended at all 
   Review Description: Pathetic and unprofessional installation by Jeeves. The guys who did installation were like some illiterate people in my area and they even didn't know how to run, they just know how to bury screw with hammer and hold compressor upon it, that too is tilted now.
The installation was so pathetic that I had to contact Voltas Customer care and I am being asked to pay 2500 plus 18% GST to fix gas leakage issue. The reason of gas leakage was not proper connection between tubes by Jeeves. Never recommend such expensive product to buy online
