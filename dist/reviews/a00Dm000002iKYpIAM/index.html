   Review Name: Disappointed with the installation.. YMMV 
   Review Description: Ok, here is the catch.. i bought it when the ad said 500rs for standard installation. looks like, so called "standard installation"  covers only 3 meters. In my case i had to go for extra 3 meters, so i ended up paying 3900Rs.. jut to fit the AC..  stand 750rs, service charge 750rs per meter, pipe cover fitting, stand fitting, and then regular installation fee blah blah.. so i felt they ripped me off.. 

bottom line, check the stores near you, they do this for free..

Quality wise, i just bought it and yet to find out.. hence the 2 stars.
