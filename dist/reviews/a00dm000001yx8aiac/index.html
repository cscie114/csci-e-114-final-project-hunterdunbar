   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: Flipkart delivery was hassle-free. AC installation was smooth, except issue of drain pipe which we fixed later. AC is quite powerful. Our room size is 130 sq. ft. with east facing window. Cooling is sufficient at 60% 26Â°C which we reduce to 40% with 3 hr sleep timer at night. AC don't have side swing, we have to manually set it. AC remote side swing button is dummy. AC remote is not backlit. Overall good experience, enjoying cool summer days.
