   Review Description: Cooling is quick. Within 5 mins temperature will start dropping. I live in Mumbai and we do not get direct sunlight so walls are not very hot and AC doesn't have to struggle much. But i feel compressor is powerful. With dual inverter the output is quick. Outdoor unit is also very quiet. We have been using regularly since two months and I can say it's light on pockets as well.
Dual Inverter compressor = 5/5
Design = 3/5 (simple average looks. Not very fancy)
Quality = 4/5
Features = 3/5 (in particular I didn't find the 6-in-1 feature to be useful. When it's already an inverter AC why would I want to run it at 80% or 60% capacity. Compressor would anyways run at variable speed)
Wifi connectivity would have been really good. nowadays u easily get a smart AC at this price.
Installation: the installation team wasnt very helpful. I had to sit and wreck my brains with them. They try to increase charges by suggesting options that would require extra copper wires n stuff. Flipkart should start looking better options than Jeeves.
