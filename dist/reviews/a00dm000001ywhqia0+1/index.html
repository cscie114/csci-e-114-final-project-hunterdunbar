   Review Name: Waste of money! 
   Review Description: I am not at all satisfied with the installation of AC by the person from Blue star, in one year they said coolent finished, they refilled it as it was in warranty period. We enjoyed cooling after gas refilled for one month, now again the cooling finished, AC is blowing air like heater after use of 5 minutes.
