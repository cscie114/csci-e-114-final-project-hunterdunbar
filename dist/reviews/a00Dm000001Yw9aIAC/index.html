   Review Name: Good quality product 
   Review Description: My room is over 150sq feet. But the a.c cools it pretty quickly. Not sure about energy efficiency since I'm yet to use it properly and see the outcome on my electricity bill. But it definitely is value for money. Just keep in mind that the installation is going to prove heavy on your pocket if you buy it online. But you get the best price on Flipkart in comparison to offline stores..
