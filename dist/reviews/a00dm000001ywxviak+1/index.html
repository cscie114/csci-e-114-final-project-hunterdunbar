   Review Description: product is very good. installation took a very long time. and the guys came for installation behaved like rowdy. he wanted to drill a fresh hole to pull the copper wires when there is a dedicated hole provided by builder, didn't understand why. installation took whole 4 hrs. installation charge was only 600 but the extra accessories costed me 4k.
