   Review Description: Very Nice product.  There was a delay in installation by day or two but it's okay.  Now it's almost one month I am using this product.  Daily we are running it for 8-10hrs on 25-26Â°C and at the end of the month our total electricity bill increased by 600/- only. which was not expected at all,  I was expecting a increase by minimum 1000/- - 1500/- ðŸ‘
