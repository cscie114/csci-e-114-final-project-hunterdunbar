   Review Name: Good! 
   Review Description: I have been using this for about two weeks now, and i  must say its pretty good. 
works fine, cools the room with in couple of mins. Delivery and installation was done on the same day which was good. But the only negative thing about it was the installation fee with was  very high. I would rather suggest if you have the time and patience, do go and purchase it rather than doing it online. It makes  quiet a huge difference.

AC- 4
Delivery- 4 
Installation charges -  -1

If you are planning to buy the Stabilizer, I do prefer buy it separately as the stabilize which will be suggested by the installation person will be on higher side.
