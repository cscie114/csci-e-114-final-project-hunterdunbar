   Review Description: The LG Dual inverter window AC is quite cool .. its look is unique, it will warn you when your gas is going low. Its a window AC, so it's simply work like other ones but the one thing you get in this is its look. LG really done a good job. You will get a 10 year compressor warranty and 2 free service for 1 year, and the gas is free for 1 year. If you are looking for the window AC than you are good to go for this one. Its totally worth it. Thank you :)
