   Review Name: Fabulous! 
   Review Description: 1.5 ton is far better even for a bigger room also, like mine is 2400 sq ft and till now working fine.....but yes as far as efficiency goes it takes long time to cool and to become stagnant after long tym which is much important for energy consumption(which is little high)...
