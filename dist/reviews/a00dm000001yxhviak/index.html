   Review Name: Slightly disappointed 
   Review Description: Based on decent reviews purchased this product almost 15 months back. Right from delivery issues popped up. Remote was faulty and for replacement needed to wait a fortnight. Low cooling was the next problem with frequent cut off happening of exterior unit. Then dripping issues. All these were brought to notice of service engineers and they made stop gap arrangements. Now after warranty expiry, they identified mother board issue as the perinnial problem, which costs 4K approx., inclusive of service charge.
Wish better luck for new buyers
