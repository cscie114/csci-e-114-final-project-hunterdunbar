   Review Description: After a lot of research, i decided to go with this 1ton 5 star product from LG. The product is perfect for my 132 sqft room, above which is terrace n receives direct sunlight throughout the day....The Design n cooling is fantastic. The packaging n delivery by Flipkart was prompt and excellent. However, the installation team from LG lack expertise to some extent. They didn't have much knowledge of the remote control features. Installation charges - Rs 999/-(inclusive of taxes), Outdoor unit stand(LG brand)- Rs 1000/- + Labour charge for d stand - Rs 200. Total installation costed me Rs 2200/-. Its working fine without stabilizer as of now. My experience says, 1ton is enough for 130 to 140 sqft room if the room is sealed and there's no way for air leakage. So far so good.
