   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: The product seems to be great. very nice product, stylish. On time delivery by Flipkart. Order was placed on 13th of May and was delivered on 15th of May. Installation was done by LG service centre technicians by 17th of May. They took an amount of Rs 1,905( including Rs  499 and some other rates of drilling and the shelf brackets. Also with their fees which was not mentioned on the bill provided by LG.) The AC runs well in our old type of house. It takes 25-30 minutes to cool the entire room of 161 sqft. First after opening the Ac will run at it's lowest of 18 degrees. Himalaya Cool is also a good option for faster cooling which must be switched after 5 minutes of running the Ac at 18. The outdoor Unit was too heavy compared to other Acs. It must have had been because of the Dual Inverter compressor. The indoor unit is quiet during operation compared to other ACs. Overall the product is very good. On time delivery by Flipkart. Polite service by LG technicians. A good value for money alternative in the conditions of kolkata instead of Voltas, carrier and all.
