   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: This is good. It takes 5-10 to make a 10*10 room with 11feet height cooler at 42Â° summer day. I wanted 1.5 ton but this is serving my purpose at almost half the electricity. I don't have a reason to reduce the star rating. the installation guy allotted for my place isn't good and made mess with the pipes.
