   Review Name: Decent product 
   Review Description: Evwn though it says inverter ac but there is no such function which makes you believe its an inverter ac. The external unit is extremely noisy as compared to other cheaper inverter ac's . No teflon tape provided,no drain pipe provided and the price is also higher as compared to other ac brands.
