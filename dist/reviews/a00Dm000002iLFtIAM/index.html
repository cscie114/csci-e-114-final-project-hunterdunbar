   Review Name: Good 
   Review Description: For my room it is perfect, but it's noise makes a big issue, it is not noiser then other but it give equal noise to other AC. Compare to bigger room this AC is for small room, where distance between you and AC is relevantly small, you will have to put up with noise, hence I recommend Split AC, then window AC
