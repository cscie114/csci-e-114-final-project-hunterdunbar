   Review Name: Decent product 
   Review Description: Device got delivered on 17th and 18th we had technicians for installation.

The technicians didn't even know to speak properly nd they just explained on off button in AC.....nd just used a small part of extra wire nd outdoor stand for installation.....

They charged double the installation charge . It's really unacceptable. 

Please do tell the extra charges before installation rather than giving a sudden shock. Still product needs to be tested for further review
