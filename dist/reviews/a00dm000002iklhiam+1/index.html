   Review Name: Not recommended at all 
   Review Description: The technician who came to install AC forgot to connect the drain pipe to the AC. He just touched the drain pipe with other pipes that connects the outdoor unit and forgot to give the connection to the drain pipe with AC.
You may guess what had been the consequences. Though the other technician resolved the issue but by then my wall was spoiled.
UPDATE- Writing this after 1.5 years of usage. AC has stopped working properly. No cooling.
