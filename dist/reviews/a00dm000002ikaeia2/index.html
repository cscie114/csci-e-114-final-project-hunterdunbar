   Review Description: Very bad installation experience by voltas. How ever the installation guy came within 1 hr of delivery. Installation person was in so mich hurry, not willing to listen to any reasonable instruction. Did the installation in an hour. Paid 1180 for installation and 750 for wall stand. Not paid anything extra not even demanded.

Very nice product from Voltas, no noise at all. Instant cooling. Good looking,sleek. Overall a good product
