   Review Name: Horrible 
   Review Description: Very unsatisfactory product from LG some featured functionalities which is available in the remote is not working when we click on the buttons and Flipkart simply cheating people with their false promises. When I purchased the product they said installation and demo charges are free. But now there are saying we have to pay charges for the installation. My point is whenever u buy the product in flipkart please check with flipkart team clearly why because they are not allowing to cancel product the once they delivered.
