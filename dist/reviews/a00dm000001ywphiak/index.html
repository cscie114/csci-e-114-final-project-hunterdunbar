   Review Description: Best product you can buy.
I have used Mitushubishi Imported, diakin (In office) & Hitachi ACs (In Home).


It's not only about cooling, the ambience that matters My most loved feature - It's unnoticeable noise of indoor as well as outdoor (make sure they install rubber cushion below outdoor). You hardly notice any kind of noise or sounds from machine after cooling at low to medium fan speed. 

Rest all other features are as good as mentioned in specifications.
It operates at around 450-550 watts after cooling in 20 minutes.

Thanks LG & Flipkart for making summer enjoyable and affordable.
