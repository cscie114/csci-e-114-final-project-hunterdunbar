   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: Excellent air-conditioner, fast cooling mode is very efficient. I have taken 2T variant, good for large drawing room.
Got real worthy discount, including points and card based. Installation in one day, but need to pay extra. Overall a very good purchase.
