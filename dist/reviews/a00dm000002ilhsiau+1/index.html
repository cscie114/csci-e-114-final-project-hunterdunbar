   Review Name: Just okay 
   Review Description: Please dont wait for jeeves service engg to install your  product as it will happen on time. I waited for 3 days, written mail to jeeves and contacted on thr customer care but believe me they didnt even bother to respond for a service for which they are charging 1600 rs. I got the product install from private local vendor the product is working fine. Thr is some noticeable fan noise even at the lowest speed. The product got delivered on time by flipkart. Contact voltas customer care they will arrange an installation service for u or contact some private vendor. Flipkart should seriously take this jeeves service.
