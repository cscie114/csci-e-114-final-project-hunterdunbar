   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: Here is my review after 5  days experience
Pros:
1. It cools the Room less than 5 minutes if the room size is in b/w (110-150 Sqft).
2. This LG dual inverter comes with another option to cool the room quickly ie., 'High Cool' option. It cools the room in less than 2 min. This feature is very useful if you came from heavy sun & tiered.
3. Less Noise. Its noise around 30 dB
4. No need of stabilizer.
5. It brings new look to your room as it has sleek design.
6. We can control the energy savings through "Energy control" option. It reduces the power consumption.

Cons:

1. Time setting is not very clear. Only educated people can handle this option.To my knowlede it should be easily understandable by everyone.
2. When ever we use any button in remote, the beep sounds from indoor unit is little bit high. It may disturb others sleep..
