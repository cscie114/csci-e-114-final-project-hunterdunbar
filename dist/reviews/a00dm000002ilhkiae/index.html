   Review Name: Bad quality 
   Review Description: delivery was very quick.. But the problem was with installation service. not well trained.. charged me 6000 including stabilizer which is 2000.. overall it was very expensive. Better to go for retailer shop if they charge extra 2000 rupee than the online which includes free instillation.. I am disappointed with the Flipkart service this time... including installation retailer was charging 32000 but Flipkart charged me 34000 overall...
