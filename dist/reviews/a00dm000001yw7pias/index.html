   Review Description: Hello everyone, I generally don''t write review. But, I will write for this one because I have heard many negative feedback about flipkart on Quora and I was in doubt whether to purchase it from Flipkart or not.
Lets talk about Flipkart first.
Delivery was on time and It was free. 
Installation was also free however you have to pay for stands (750 Rupees in my case) . Voltage regulator is optional.
So, overall I am happy with the service of flipkart.
Now, coming to AC
It's around 1000 watt machine works on Single Phase power supply  which do produce humming sound (which is quite normal). Cooling is pretty good and fast. I have been using this product for last 10 days and I have not found any issue with cooling.
Overall this product is good.
