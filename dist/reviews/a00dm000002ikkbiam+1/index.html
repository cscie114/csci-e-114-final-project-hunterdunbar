   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: Look and performance of cooling is good....but it is only good in cool mode...and the Turbo and other modes are not so effective. There is a sleepmode given which is helpful and effective. Will have to wait and see the electric consumption later...but the system of compresure getting auto off is not working in normal cool mode and if I switch to other mode then the cooling is not that strong
