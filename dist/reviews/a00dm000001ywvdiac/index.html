   Review Name: Very poor 
   Review Description: This machine is a piece of JUNK. It was great the first 2 months. Cooling was nice. but after 2 months, it does not work efficiently. You have to switch on the fan if you want any sort of cooling. Without the fan you are going to feel HOT. Himalayan Cooling.... I still am waiting to get some kind of cooling, forget a Himalayan effect. Rubbish product, useless pricing, faltu company and unit. I seriously recommend NOT buying this product. If you want to, then take mine at half the price. JUNK.
