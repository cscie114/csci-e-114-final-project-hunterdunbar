   Review Description: I wanted non inverter ac because of our room requirement,it always get direct sunlight so room is always warmer.
I've another Blue star non inverter ac as well as inverter ac which were way costlier then this for which I've paid 28999/-

This model (FA312PLU) is good at cooling the room which is always hot,but takes little time,Room size 100sq ft

Disadvantages i observed are
It doesn't get backlight in remote so we can't control it in dark.
Doesn't have i feel feature 

Rest everything is fine and gets its job done.

Installation was done by Blue star technician next day of delivery. Masking tape or duct tape was not available with them for piping which i think is necessary and I will be getting it done by them in 1st service.
Charges were:-
1000 for Installation 
750 for stand
365 tax and gst
350 for power point
