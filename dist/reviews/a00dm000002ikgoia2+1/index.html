   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: I thought I shall give a detailed review, so took a week time after I got delivery. I bought AC during sale days @ 27500 after getting instant discount of 1500 using HDFC card. First, my product landed at Indore on 17 may and I kept on requesting flipkart executive to get it delivered same day or next day but she expressed inability saying she does not have any control on delivery people. Amazing piece of info, is it not. it was delivered on 20th may, the scheduled date. so not much of complaining about that.
I read reviews here about installation and many wise people suggested to get it installed by voltas authorised technician and not by Jeeves. I contacted voltas helpline only to get lacklustre assurance about visit of technician. Finally after four days of coercing, cajoling, one technician turned up. he inspected room and the building and then declared that my flat is not fit for a split Ac and I should buy window ac. Completely dejected, I thought of returning product. but then I also thought to give Jeeves a try who were constantly buzzing me over mobile. Then today one technician from Jeeves turned up and he could install AC in three hours. A neat installation. he charged 1600 and left the place. The third party associates of voltaz are bunch of fly by night kind of unskilled technicians and are not that trustworthy.  
AC is working fine and I am getting coooool air too. Everything is so nice. Thanks flipkart.
thanks for bearing with my  lenghty review.
