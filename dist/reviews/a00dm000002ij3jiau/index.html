   Review Description: 5 star for the AC, but the installation team was very messy. After installing, they didn't clear the mess, neither they thought for a second to work in such a way so that the cement and concrete dusts (caused by drilling the wall) don't get spilled inside the whole room. After they went, I had to clean the room for 2 days. Even after that I couldn't make it as clean as it was before. 0 star for the installation.
