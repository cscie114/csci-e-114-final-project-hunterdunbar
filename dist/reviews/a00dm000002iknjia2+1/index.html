   Review Description: Nice Product. Go for it. installation they charged 1400 rs and mentioned that the mounting angle is 850 plus 500 installation charges and 70 for white cement. it's working fine. very less noisy, that's awesome. Still don't know about the electricity consumption amount, let's c. I was planning for Media which is less cost around 7k, but my wife did not agree for that. so finally I got LG but to be honest am not regretting it. my stabilizer is on the way ....but it is running fine without stabilizer without any issues. All electronics item in home are recently purchased from LG only ( washing machine n Refrigerator), all r fabulous.
