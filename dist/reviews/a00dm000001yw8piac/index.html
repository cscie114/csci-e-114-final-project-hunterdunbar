   Review Name: Terrific purchase 
   Review Description: The performance is very soft and excellent cooling experience that starts from 24 degrees. Totally worth for money but the indoor unit is very small in size, though it is 1.5 Ton but in size wise view it looks like 1 Ton and next coming to swing mode - There are 5 different positions of swing directions but while functioning in full swing mode it doesn't reach its 5th direction of swing, that is the only drawback and in remaining parameters it is the best one at this price...
