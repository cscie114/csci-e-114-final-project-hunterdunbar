   Review Name: Very Good 
   Review Description: Happy with the product, features and service, not sue about consumption of electricity, also there is issue with Swing, it doesn't swing completely from lower to uper. Automatically it swings from mid to uper. But if I want to get air in loweside, then physically I have to press the swing into the lower side, then it swings from very lower to mid only. And very much disappointed with the installation. They charged extra Rs. 100 as bribe for doing nothing extra ordinary work, wherein offer price was only Rs. 699. Also, they had not done electrical and plumbing work. Even I asked them to do the same and I will pay for it, still they denied.
