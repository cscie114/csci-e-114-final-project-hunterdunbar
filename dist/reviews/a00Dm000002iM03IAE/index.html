   Review Name: Waste of money! 
   Review Description: Please go with blue star. This is not the best ac. In starting days there is no noise but after few weeks the noise of this ac is so high also the worst part is the no automatic swing and the quality of plastic that has been used is very cheap. I would recommend you don't look for design may be this is best in design but with cooling and quality bluestar is far better.
