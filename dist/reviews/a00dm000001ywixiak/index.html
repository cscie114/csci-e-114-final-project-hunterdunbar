   Review Name: Excellent Dual Inverter AC 
   Review Description: This is the Best AC purchase i did till now. 
Here are the advantages
1. Temperature is maintained accurate. It doesn't cool down excessively in the night time.
2.  Power Saving Feature works great. At 80% power saving, it consumes only 1 rs per min (at commercial electricity unit rate., ie. 6.5 Rs per Unit). On Normal Household meter reading, it will be much less
3.  It is almost fully quiet in low fan-speed.
4. comes with 10 year compressor warranty
5. When i took the AC i have got 5 years GAS Charging at free of cost, which is a boon.

No disadvantages as such. Just enjoy a Quiet AC with accurate temperature with loads of savings on cost.
