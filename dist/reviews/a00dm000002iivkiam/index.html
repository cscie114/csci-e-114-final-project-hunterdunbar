   Review Name: Very Good 
   Review Description: Firstly I was little apprehensive about voltas windows AC as in my previous house we had voltas split AC which was good for nothing.
But this is really good, cooling is quick, being 5 star energy rating it saves electricity.
If someone is planning to buy voltas windows ac then go for 5 start energy rating only.
