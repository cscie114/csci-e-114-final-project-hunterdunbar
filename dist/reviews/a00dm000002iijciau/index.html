   Review Description: Writing review after use two week..
1- search so many ac first of all that this is the first ac ever.. Search so many product in online to choose this because blue star is a reputed brand
2- energy efficient is best in class.. Not to go 5 star because uses is small time use 3-4 hour per day.. If your uses is too many time than go for 5 star but not so very different than 3 star
3 - design is premium
4 - installed by blue star company but outer wall stand is very price high.. This guy charge me 800 for stand. This is to much.. Better to buy online any wall stand.. Almost all installment price is 2500
5- eco mode is used by upper 24'c
6- value for money
Just go for is becoz blue star is blue star..
