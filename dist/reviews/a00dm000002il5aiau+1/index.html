   Review Name: Classy product 
   Review Description: AC is good. But Voltas has reduced warranty of compressor from 10 year to 5 year.
Moreover, they don't give comprehensive warranty on purchase made from Flipkart.
Installation is poor, guy is not aware of any technical test like leakage test, voltage check etc. He made wrong hole and fittings, due to which joints are in center of wall & will be difficult if I open AC & fit to other positions.
Other brands looks attractive seeking warranty of 10 years.
