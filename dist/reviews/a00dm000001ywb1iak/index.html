   Review Name: Perfect product! 
   Review Description: Overall it's good in cooling, takes only 5 minutes to full cool the room.
But I observed that, @ 26 temperature Daikin AC gives more cooling compared to Blue star.
Otherwise overall AC is good ðŸ‘,
Energy efficiency will come to know after next electricity bill..
