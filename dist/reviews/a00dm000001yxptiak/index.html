   Review Description: After usage of 1 year .Cooling stopped .on visit of tecnician it was reported that multiple leakage in condenser coil. So it can be assumed  are using sub standard material . As Ac should be durable . customer is not going to chang ac after 1 year only. It is expected that it should last atlest 5-7 years with moderate usage.My ac was used only at night as mostly m in office in day and then also it shows defect just after guarantee expiry.and they are producing bill of 10k for repair of it
Highly not recommended. If you want to buy new ac every year you can go for Voltas.Highly disappointed .
