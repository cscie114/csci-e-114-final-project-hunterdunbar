   Review Name: Utterly Disappointed 
   Review Description: I have brought this AC on 2nd April 2019 and still waiting for installation. Voltas ppl are worst they just came to my flat and asked me to pay 10K for installation .

Farbrigation work : 6k+Gst
Installation:1.5k
Stand : 850 + GST
Core cutting :2200 +GST

I did fabrication work from outside cost me 1500,and no need to do core cutting and can be done by making hole in wall 

They know everything but still trying to charge extra money 

I asked them to come back later and  they told me if I do installation from outside vendor warranty will be lapse ..entire week I m did follow up ..and keep getting false promise that person will come within 24 hrs ..I think 24 hr means 1 week for Voltas ppl . finally Ac was installed on 14th Apr at 10 PM .

More-ever, product is good but not installation services .

Thank you Flip-kart
