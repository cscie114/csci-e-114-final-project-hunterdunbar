   Review Name: Best in the market! 
   Review Description: Nice and efficient AC. It Cools 100+ sqft within 5 min. Very silent also. No other manufacturers are providing warranty on PCB. No doubt best AC in the market.
 No light and glowing buttons in remote is a drawback. Jeeves service is not good. 
I got it installed from LG directly. I'll suggest to book installation request through LG customer care itself.
