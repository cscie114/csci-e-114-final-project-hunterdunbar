   Review Description: Good for 100 sq. Ft room. In 1 hour it takes almost 0.8 unit of electricity which is pretty good. Sometimes during peak temperature it lags behind in cooling by 10%. Also my room is on terrace with direct sunlight coming all day from two sides, it does a pretty good job in cooling if used with a ceiling fan on low speed. 
Overall its a great product. I got it for only 15k( dÃ mm cheap)  during Big Billion Days so I can say that its a great value for money
