   Review Name: Good product 
   Review Description: Slightly smaller than I expected, but nevertheless good cooling for a small room.

The installation was not great - They did not take off the cardboard pads inside the outdoor unit, which in turn reduced the effectiveness of cooling. Realised it after struggling with in-effective cooling for a few days. Once those were removed, the AC started working very well..
