   Review Name: Does the job 
   Review Description: AC is good. But cooling is not that much faster. Go for 1.5 ton. Fitting is not done properly by the LG technician. He was concentrated on selling the out door unit stand for 900 Rs. He didn't give bill for the stand. Installation charge is 1770. Better buy AC from any showroom. The price will be around 2000 extra. But they will do fitting for free and you will have good control.
