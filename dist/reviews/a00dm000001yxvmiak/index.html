   Review Name: Fabulous! 
   Review Description: This AC doesnâ€™t cools like chilling winter, it creates smooth,sweet environment when turned on such a unique feature.

Its silent feature is simply awesome. The AC works very silently.Loving this.

Hardly room temperature comes under 23 degree. The Himalayan Cooling is very good.

Flipcart services very confusing,they first told me that the installation would be free of cost.However,LG services was awesome.They were quick to resolve my issue.

Installation cost was 999/-.

Must buy product in this range!
