   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: If your requirement is to run AC for 6-8 hrs per day, stick with 3 star and save a lot of money. Dont go for 4 or 5 stars as they are for more than avg usage. Now coming to the product, the cooling is unmatched. Really. I never had to bring down the temperature below 24 even is extreme summers. So, on that aspect.. you can totally depend on it. Another thing is the after sales service. I would say it's good and your work will be done upto the mark. Placing the requests for services or complaints is extremely easy and the service time is also less. So in short, the product is great in terms of quality, after sales service and ofcourse the price.
