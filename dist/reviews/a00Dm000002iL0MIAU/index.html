   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: My room size is approx 132 sq ft. So this AC is very ideal choice 1.5 ton.
Look is good. 
Cooling is good.
Fan in ac is bit noisy. (Tata please work on silent ac or very less noise ac)
Check the AC decibal before buying. I had LG and panasonic in options but nothing was getting delivered quickly, so i purchased this one. Also i am not so fond of wifi ac, as habituated with ac remote.
Being a tata product, you will feel safe.
Pretty much happy with the product.
