   Review Name: Worst experience ever! 
   Review Description: One of the worst product and service.  AC delivered on 31 Jan 2021 .  Installation Charge claimed be by was around 5000 ( Includes outdoor unit ) . Since then it is continuously giving problems. Due to some leakage issues, it didn't work . So far we used the AC only 
2 times and LG technical team is not able to fix the issues. So in a nutshell, LG team couldnt fix the cooling problem since 31 Jan 2021.
Now AC is just a showpiece for me . 

Better go for some other brands .
