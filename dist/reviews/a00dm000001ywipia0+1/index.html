   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: So after using this ac from last three months.here is my review.This is best energy saving ac.i use ac on daily basis for 15hours minimum .10hour during night time and 5 6 hour during day time on F3fan speed with 40percent power saving mode ..trust me i am only getting 1000 to 1200 rs electricity bill on monthly basis for my 3bhk house where i am using all other components also consuming electricity .cooling is very nice just run the Himalaya cooling mode for 10min and then change to power saving mode and enjoy the cool breeze...Seems value money with no ac sound...must buy it seems bit costly bt in long run its great deal and great product
