   Review Name: Must buy! 
   Review Description: Really, it is awesome! You must buy it. It is better than my expectation. It is better from all ways like it is an inverter air conditioner, it has a 5-star rating by BEE, the used gas is 'R32' which is the best air conditioner gas. Also, it is a 1.6-ton air conditioner which is the best comfortable tonnage rating for my room..
