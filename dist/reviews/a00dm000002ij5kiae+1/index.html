   Review Name: Value-for-money 
   Review Description: Flipkart teams has a very slow and incompetent installation team. Their customer service is just icing on the cake. No calibration. 

The product from LG is good, as always. Cools the room rather faster than expected. 

Doesn't consume much energy.

Would recommend
- purchase here but get the installation done from a local or LG technicians.
- purchase it from some where else.
