   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: Superb Air Conditioner!!!
 I did so much research before buying my first AC. At last my hard work came to an end, when I found this master piece.
I want to give specific Review.
Pros:
1. Awesome cool looks. It will really blow your mind. 
2. Build quality is Superb. Better than Carrier.
3. Feature rich, like Room temperature indicator, dehumidifier, almost all type of inbuilt filter, Himalayan Cool technology, Dual Inverter etc. etc.
4. Awesome service from LG. The installation team is superb. They charge me 499 for installation & 750 for Outdoor Unit stand. But the are humble & caring(most Important)
5. Cooling capacity is top notch. It took hardly 2.5 to 3 minutes to cool 132 Sq. Feet room.
6. Almost silent indoor unit operation. You will hardly notice any sound.
Cons:
Practically nothing, trust me. 
Verdict:
If you are planning to buy an 5*(2019) AC with Inverter technology, without any second thought, simply buy this One. Trust Me you will be amazed by the performance of this South Korean Giant.
I know there is some bad reputation of LG AC. But that is only for their Aluminium Condenser. LG has corrected that one and has come up with their highly efficient copper condenser with Ocean black protection along with 10 years warranty of the dual Inverter compressor. 
So a must Buy, at the end of the Day.
