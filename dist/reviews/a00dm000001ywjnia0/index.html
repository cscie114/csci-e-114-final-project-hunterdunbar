   Review Name: Very Good 
   Review Description: I have been using it for the last 4 months.
Pros
1. Good design matches the bedroom
2. 4 directional sweeping of cool air
3. Somewhat silent operation
4. Energy efficient.
Cons
1. Noise level is a bit high just opposite to what is claimed in the Ad. 
2. Operation is not as intelligent as the Daikin 4 star AC also owned by me. 
3. They should have provided deodorant feature on the AC. Sometimes we feel a foul smell.
Overall, the AC was a good purchase and it has been working to my satisfaction. Definitely I recommend the product.
