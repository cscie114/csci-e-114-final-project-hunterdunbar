   Review Name: Useless product 
   Review Description: This is two year long term review of the product. My ac had issues of less cooling from starting itself. I dont know the reason since the service person himself could not do anything except cleaning filter and checking pressure of gas. I installed stabilizer as well even though it was not recommended but still it cools very less. On HC mode it runs for half an hour and then on 18 degrees even when outside temp is just 30 degrees. But even running whole night on 18 it cant bring the room temp down to 23 (proof attached,  ignore the time on remote, its not synced with normal time). I am still in contact with lg for some solution but have not received any fruitful result till now. I would request everyone to think and research proper before buying the product. And if you have bought it only then immediately after installation insist to perform a cooling test and if the same is not successful return it promptly. Best of luck
