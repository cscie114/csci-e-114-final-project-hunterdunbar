   Review Description: excellent product.. no sound at all.. excellent cooling...    it comes with an indoor unit and an outdoor unit.. and two pipes and a connection wire around 2 meter... i would recommend u to get it installed from lg engineer directly.. else you will cost 3 to 4 thousands more if you get installed by flipcart.
