   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: I am quite amazed with the product and the value deal which I have got for a Voltas product. Ita exactly 2montha till now that we've installed it and has given us a super cooling and has proven to be cost effective as well. 
The only glitch is its remote which is quite old fashioned and very big and can become quite difficult at times. But as a product we have got a very good product and full marks for it.
