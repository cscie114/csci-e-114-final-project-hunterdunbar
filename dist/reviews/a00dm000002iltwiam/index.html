   Review Name: Don't waste your money 
   Review Description: Totally disappointed aftwr purchasing this from the Day one of installation started giving problems at first place there was sensor issue which got fixed . Now loud noise is coming from the indoor unit like it's an air cooler .
Form a brand like Blue Star it it's just pathetic , contracted the customer service they are just  coming and creating mess in my room by cleaning a brand new machine with jet spray and stuff.
Re consider your decision before buying.
