   Review Name: Good quality product 
   Review Description: It's a very good AC. The only problem I face with this A C is it's 'Remote'. Whenever I try to switch On the AC the time will blink in the remote and the AC will not get On. Sometimes I have to take the batteries out to make the remote work. I bought 2 AC and same thing is happening with these 2 A C's. Other than this it is very good AC. It cools fast and silent
