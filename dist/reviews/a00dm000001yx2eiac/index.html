   Review Name: Just wow! 
   Review Description: The delivery was superfast and no damage on the box or product. The look of the product is very sleek and clean and perfect for my room. The cooling is very fast and effective. It seems it doesn't take up a lot of electricity but will be sure enough after a month or so. Pretty happy with my purchase.

The installation guys were very skillful and polite. Did a very good job. The only concern that I have is on the number of follow ups I had to with the vendor company to get it installed. They rescheduled the dates on their own. I had to call the toll free number to escalate the matter.
