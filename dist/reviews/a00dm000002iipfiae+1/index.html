   Review Name: Nice 
   Review Description: At the time of installation. Technician arrived as agreed. Specified charge was Rs 750/-. Additional costs as under: 
1. Movement of existing bracket ( needlessly) : 500 
2. Tape for taping the connecting the pipe: 200 
3. Cost of but, bolt and screw: Rs 300 ( false as they used old items from their bags) 
4. Did not affix hole sleeve or cap as they didn't know what that was. Instead demanded that I provide white cement which I did not have so left me with a broken damaged wall. Stuffed it with thermocol when I pointed it out. 
5. Total cost including chai pani Rs 1600/- which I felt was not justified. 
6. However their work was good and behaviour was satisfactory. 
7. Will update on ac performance after three weeks.
