   Review Description: DISAPPOINTED
      I purchased voltas 1 ton ac invoice date 13.4.2017...it is mentioned in Details column that the product is 1 year service warrenty and 4 years for compresser..free installation made by flipkart by jeeves..
     Now i make a call to voltas for service....they are asking amount for service even it is within warrenty period.they are saying that flipkart arranged the installation.so we are asking to pay..be carefull with installation and service...
   Product ok type only...noise definitely high..go for inverter model.
