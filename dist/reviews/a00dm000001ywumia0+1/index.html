   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: Firstly,thanks to flipkart for faster delivery.Installation was done very next day after receiving product.Fully satisfied with cooling.
Pros:
1.High cooling is the best feature in this ac as it cools room quickly.(HC button is shown in the wireless remote).
2.Latest technology used.
3.As it claims"Quieter than a whisper".Sound is really quieter.
4.No stabalizer needed,power consumption is less comparing to other ac(5 star)
5.Swing function is of two types:vertical and horizontal....it covers entire room and cools within 2 minutes.
Cons:
Nothing
Lg's dual inverter AC is the best to buy in a budget of 50K.So without any worries you can trust this AC.Every feature is awesome.
Ratings:
Cooling-5/5
Value for money-5/5
Installation-5/5.
