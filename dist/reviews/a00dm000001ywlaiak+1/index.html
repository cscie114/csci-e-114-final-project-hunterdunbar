   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: Using for last 10 days. No issue found yet. Perfectly running. Cooling is very fast. Remote functionalities are user friendly. Flipkart  delivered next day and installation done by LG within one day. Though installation done smoothly but the installation guys are not professional they broken the wall plaster and color in many places and one person called me and continuously pushing me to get extra services like wrapping of copper pipe, vocum of the compressor, water pipe more than required etc. Atlast I purchased the outdoor unit stand from them at rs 850 which is actually very higher than market. Water pipe 21 rs per ft + GST. My requirement was 6ft but they pushed me to buy 8ft. In my case overall installation cost was rs 1600 including 499 standard installation charge. I suggest for LG product insulation tape wrapping is not required for outdoor coper pipes as it already has one fome cover which is Good.
