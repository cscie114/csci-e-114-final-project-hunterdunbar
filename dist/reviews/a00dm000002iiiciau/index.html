   Review Name: Delightful 
   Review Description: Itâ€™s a amazing AC.. Effective cooling and very silent while in use.. 
** 1 star is deducted because of the remote.. Remote has no light neither there are radiant buttons which makes it difficult to use at night when there is no light.. Hope LG works on it as it is a very essential feature. Other than that itâ€™s a very good product..
