   Review Name: Good choice 
   Review Description: Ac is working fine no problem faced till now using this ac from 2 weeks. Features are very good Sleep feature and timing off feature are really helpful. Cooling is very good.
One problem i will mention that it produces lot of sound but that is not a problem in the day time but in the night sound is enough to disturb you.

Apart from that overall I will give 4.5 out of 5 for this Ac .
