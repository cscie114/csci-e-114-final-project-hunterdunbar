   Review Description: Product is nice n delivered on time as promised by flipkart.

But the return n refund policy is not fair for AC items.

Wrongly booked Aluminium condenser but they not replacing or changing the order even tough i said to order immediately on copper.
At last going to install only.Let's c how AL condenser life as compare to Copper condenser.

While buying it was in cash back of 3000 Rs Offer for 1st 100 customers but after 2 days the price down and same prize.flipkart has to concentrate their customers n offer value. i not got that cash back also...even i booked next day itself....flipkart saying within 1 day other customer might booked more than 100.  All in the business game.
