   Review Name: Just wow! 
   Review Description: this is a comprehensive review after using it for about 2 week's. I purchased it for 28.5 k and I did installation by local expert guy as Jeeves would also charge me for the same so why not a local expert. AC was installed properly.
I Use Iot In 10 * 12 ft room and it serve it purpose of keeping the room cool. This Summer I Am Escaping Heat Like A Pro.
the installation guy told me something that I am sure of. he recommend people to buy SPLIT over Inverter For low Power consumption. and literally he mean it.
So I Would Consider This fact while purchasing the next AC for my another room. probably the recently launched media brand.
