   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: If you want an energy efficient a.c with good cooling you can go for it, at energy saver mode(24'c) its consumption is about 500 watt. I personally inspected my metre to prove the same. The only negative is its design which personally doesn't attract me
