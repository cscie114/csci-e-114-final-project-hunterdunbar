   Review Description: Nice AC with design and feature. But its taking some time to cool my room. My room is 120 sqft. Its take nearly 10 to 12 minutes to cool my room. I saw its consume nearly 4unit with 60% energy saving mode when i run it for 6 hours at night.
But if you can effort this energy consume you can go with this. For delivery and installation it is nice. Same day installation.
I bought this ac at 34000 with flipkart offer. And Installation cost me 2400. Overall its a good purchase as a value wise and feature wise. Thnak you flipkart
