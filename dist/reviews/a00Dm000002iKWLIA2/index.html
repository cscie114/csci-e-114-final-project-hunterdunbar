   Review Name: Value-for-money 
   Review Description: Looks Good (LG)....Over all a good team work by fk n LG.
Ac has a good cooling time. Hope it will conserve energy n help in cost reduction. Little noisy but will do. Over all can buy within 37k. But LG installation is a loot. It will cause a big hole in our pockets. So 4 star rating.
