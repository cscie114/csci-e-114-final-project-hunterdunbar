   Review Name: Just wow! 
   Review Description: Itâ€™s a nice AC with good remote and features. Cools very well. We used it for three months and got only 7k bill. We use it with 80% power saving mode with comfort air. Delivery was good and had to pay extra for brackets for the outdoor unit. Go for it. Great product
