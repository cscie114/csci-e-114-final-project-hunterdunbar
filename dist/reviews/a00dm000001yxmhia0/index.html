   Review Name: Not good 
   Review Description: I have purchased this 5 Month back from flipkart. Its quite energy efficient, my room suze is 10 x 12, i think its a defective product because its maximum cooling capacity is 22 degree, if i set temperature in 17, it will never achieve that temperature, it will stop at 22 degree.  I complained in LG customer care,  but problem not solved till now
