   Review Name: Highly recommended 
   Review Description: Works fine,but lack features compaired to lg split ac model.

But overall good one.

I use wifi all time
Sleep mode save lot of energy and runs the unit as low as 100 watts


Fan mode is good,i. Use this fan mode after 2 h of ac running,uses 110 watts .

Lot to say,no time 
If u can get an split ac go for it,if u purely want an window ac then go for it.
