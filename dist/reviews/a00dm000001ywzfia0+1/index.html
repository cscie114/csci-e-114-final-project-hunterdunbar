   Review Name: Excellent 
   Review Description: Disadvantage/Cons:   Service manual book was not given inside the box...i called the LG service centre they said it shud be there but may be flipkart not provided it. Another most important thing to notice the warranty card was not provided with LG company rubber stamp whereas if we buy from any showrooms seller provide all necasary manual papers. There is no where mentioned the AC is 1.5ton  either on bill or on the box...Rooms gets cool if we press only Himalay Cool (HC) button on the remote or else keeping around 20'c will not get cool faster as noticed. AC Design is very simple.  But with this price range and brand like LG i am satisfied and loved the deal. Hope servicing also goes thru well after 3 months.
