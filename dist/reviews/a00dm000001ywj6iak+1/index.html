   Review Description: This is my experience after using it for more than a month. This AC is an excellent product from LG. Cooling is great, it cools my 18ft*12ft room within 7-8 mins to 23 degree C. You don't need more cooler rooms anyway. However, this AC even can drop temperature hoto 18 degrees if you want. The design is sleek and beautiful. Simple and elegant, white alwaya has a decent look for any room. The power consumption is not very high. Don't go for the 5 star version expending much more if you are buying it for your home and will operate only for some specific 4-5 hours during the day. Remote is simple and easy to use, has all the required modes. 4-in-1 button is very user friendly where you can select the load for the compressor at 20%, 40%, 60% or 80% depending upon the number of people in the room. This helps in power saving to a great extent specially when you are alone or only there are 2 people in the room. Working at 60% mode means you are constantly saving 40% of the full load power consumption. In a word, this is a great product and I recommend it wholeheartedly to all buyers. Just go for it, you won't repent later!! Lastly, buying from Flipkart, LG service centre quickly send installation engineer and gets it installed immediately after delivery. 1500 rupees additional installation charges is nominal also in lockdown period. Great product from LG!! I'm loving it!!
