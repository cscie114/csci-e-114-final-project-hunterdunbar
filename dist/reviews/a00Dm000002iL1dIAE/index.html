   Review Name: Worth every penny 
   Review Description: My experience with Voltas ACs has been great, and this is not an exception. My bedroom is more than 220 sqft, and this AC deals with that just fine. Nice design and unlike previous occasions, this time the installation was very good also. The installation guys have done a neat and professional work, while maintaining all sanitization protocols.
Thumbs up!
