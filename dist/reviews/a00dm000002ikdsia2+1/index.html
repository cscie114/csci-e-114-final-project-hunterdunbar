   Review Description: Pros: This is very nice product in terms of cooling and energy efficiency with good price for this quality product.
Cons: If it would have one more horizontal stripe that would be better. Horizontal swing option is there in the remote but it is not working , would be fine without that functionality bcz vertical swing works and does the job. Story doesn't end here, even vertical swing has minor negligible defect - it swing from middle to upper part only that means if someone is exactly under the AC unit than he will not get direct wind from AC and the front wall of the room will get more direct cooling wind flow. Story continues- this defect have manual solution and it is - each time you have to pull down the strip after starting the AC, then it will swing from exact below to middle part giving uniform direct wind to the underlying bed / floor and will not hit upper front wall. 
overall very nice so giving 4, if this wud not have these minor defects then obviously this deserves 5. blindly go for it. I am using this AC since 15 months. Also some other options can be better like Midea or Loyd...
