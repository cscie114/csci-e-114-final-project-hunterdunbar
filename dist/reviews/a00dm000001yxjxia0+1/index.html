   Review Name: Moderate 
   Review Description: Product was delivered on Saturday June 1st and the installation was done today . Too slow in installation. And installation was charged 1300/- but it was said 699/- in the website. AC cooling is not that effective. 1.5 ton AC taking a lot of time to cool a 100sqft room. Totally Disappointed.
