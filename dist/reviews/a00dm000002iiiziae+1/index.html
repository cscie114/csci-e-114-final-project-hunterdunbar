   Review Name: Delightful 
   Review Description: I am dividing this review in 2 parts
1) Delivery and installation
So the delivery was quick and installation was also done in 2 days. Only problem I faced was installation charges which was around 2400rs in my case. Also the bluestar installation team doesn't have any coordination between them, basically you will get multiple calls from different bluestar installation guys in your area. Overall the installation although on pricier side went well.

2) AC
The cooling is more than enough for my room. It cools my room within a span of 10-15 mins depending upon the outdoor temperature.
Also the operation is silent compared to my other voltas ac
Remote is pretty good and AC has the required features in this budget
One thing which is missing is horizontal swing also the outlet pipe for water seems pretty weak and fragile compared to my other voltas AC
