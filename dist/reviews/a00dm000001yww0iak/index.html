   Review Name: Waste of Money (45000/-). 
   Review Description: I am writing my review here after using 10 months approximately. It was worked a bit better in first six months. Then after it is not cooling the room after I run 1 hour on 18 degrees temperature. LG support team have been coming and cleaning and saying there is nor problem. But AC not cooling the room. I am using Panasonic 3 star AC in my office, it is working excellent on temperature 24 egress only.

Finally Worst product, Don't trust the positive reviews they have, I hope they all are manipulated.
