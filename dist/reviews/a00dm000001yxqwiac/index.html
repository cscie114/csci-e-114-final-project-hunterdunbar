   Review Name: Worth every penny 
   Review Description: Product is good. Consumes a lot of units if used at 24Â°C. I am using at 29-30Â°C and it consumes 1 unit in 2 hours which is really good. That one unit is consumed by the ac, fridge and ceiling fan combined. I strongly suggest people with less budget for electricity bill to use this at 29Â°C and ceiling fan together. Works brilliantly. Installation guys were not that great, they were in a hurry to leave without finishing their work. They couldn't find time to fit the stabilizer but upon insisting a lot they did hesitantly and the compressor wasn't working first, they didn't complete the wiring properly. Else a very good product, noise is bearable but you cannot position the swing manually you have to stop it in motion unlike my haier ac. Functions are a little limited compared to other brands, remote has a backlit display but goes off soon when unused.
