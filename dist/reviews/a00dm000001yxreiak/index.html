   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: I bought this product for around 33,500 rs. Energy efficiency is great and also a good feature available. Installation is done perfectly. They didn't charge an extra price. 3 stars are more enough for those who use AC 8 hrs per day. The electricity bill also very low. No back light in the remote. Also buttons not visible during night time. So i rated 4 star
