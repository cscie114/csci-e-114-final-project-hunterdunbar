   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: I bought this AC before the start of this summer and i must say i am quite happy with it. Still remember how good both Flipkart and LG personnels were in getting everything together. 

AC itself is very good. I didnâ€™t face any problem at all the whole summer. Cooling is excellent, aesthetics are great and overall its a great package. I knew this AC didnâ€™t have auto swing but honestly i never felt the need for it. 

The noise is at par with other ACs. I didnâ€™t use sleep mode (where LG advertises it to be at the quietest) because i like the temperature to be consistent. Usually kept it at 23-24 degrees most of the time. However, i like how compressor slows down when it reaches those temperatures and the noise drops significantly. 

Used the wifi feature but the app was slower so i instead prefer used remote more. Still itâ€™s a great feature when you are outside and want to return to a cooler room. 

I didnâ€™t face a single problem throughout the summer so i am quite happy with it. 

Also, LG personnel recommended to get it serviced before every summer so ill make sure i get that done before next summer. 

Thanks Flipkart and LG.
