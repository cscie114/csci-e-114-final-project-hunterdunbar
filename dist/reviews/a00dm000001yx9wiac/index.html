   Review Description: Nice product at this price range. The cooling does take some time approx 35-45 min. My room size is 14*12 so it might take time. But cooling is not too effective. Also, it is too silent. The design is also good and comes with new digital display of temperature. 

We did not face any issues with installation as well. Had to pay 1500/- additional for installing and the stand cost of 750/- 

Would recommend to go for this brand.
