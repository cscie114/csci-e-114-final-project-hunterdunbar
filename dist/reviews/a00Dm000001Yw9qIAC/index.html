   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Product quality is too good in this price range. I would have given 5 out of 5 but their service is pathetic. I would have given minus 5 if could do so. Very bad behaviour and unholy access is there which may trouble a lot. So  be extra careful regarding installation and service part. Don't forget to get GST bill from them otherwise warranty will void. As far as flipkart's support is concerned that is excellent in fact best in India. Thanks flipkart!.
