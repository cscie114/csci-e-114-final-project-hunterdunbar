   Review Description: AC is Good, working fine but AC out side material material is so poor.
Mainly I want give my opinion about A c installation 
please do not go with VOLTAS installation. if we can ask anything to them they will ask extra amount.
Worst installation.they want money only and they are thinking that who are buying in the online they are ready to pay huge amount.
