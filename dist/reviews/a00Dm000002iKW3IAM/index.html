   Review Name: Very Good 
   Review Description: Pros: -
* Cooling is Great. 
* Indoor unit is very quiet, outdoor unit fan makes the usual noise. 

Cons: -
* Remote is generic and some features on the remote might not work for you depending on the model. 

Notes: -
* If you have a concrete wall and you need to dig a hole be ready to shell out extra anywhere between 2k to 5k depending on the thickness of the wall. 
* Installation will be quicker if you directly reach out to LG after product is delivered to you rather than waiting for flipkart to arrange it for  you.
