   Review Name: Perfect product! 
   Review Description: Best AC, Best Installation, but i can only buy extended warranty  in 30days from the date of purchase that to at 2400 for another 1 year the warranty price is too high.
Edit : The cooling is good but its way better if i can get instant cooling by the cool wave of air, so this AC is made to mount at sill level of window not attached at Lintel Level so the AC air can cool you directly at first as the air will come from top strip not as conventional side bars opening (You Understood it right!). PS : it is a matter of concernâœŒðŸ»
