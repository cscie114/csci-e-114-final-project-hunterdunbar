   Review Name: Nice 
   Review Description: Few people are complaining about cooling issue, I recommend to check the top filter of split unit whether it is cover with dust, just clean it with dry toothbrush, one of the most reasonable 1.5 inverter ac  at this price range with LG brand trust. Cooling is good takes 15 -20 mins to chill my drawing room 180sqft. Overall good performance.
