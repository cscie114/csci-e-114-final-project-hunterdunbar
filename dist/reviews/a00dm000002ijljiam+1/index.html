   Review Description: Excellent product. Got this 1.5 ton, 5 star,  dual invereter ac at just 30700/- during big billion days. Looking, cooling is excellent.

Mainly i took this ac for energy saving, since 2 days i am checking, it is consuming appx 3-4 unit from 10 PM to 6AM. It may vary based on outside climate in summer days. 

The person mr. Ansari came for installation, he is very nice and professional person. He installed ac as per my requirement and explained everything properly. Remote function also he explained very well. Go for this without AC without doubt. 

Energy consumption, i will update after one month.
