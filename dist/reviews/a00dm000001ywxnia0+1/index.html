   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: My review after 2 month of heavy usage.
AC only runs at full speed at start for few minutes (6.9Amp), and when it senses the drop in room temperature by few degrees it starts to reduce power consumption (upto 2.4amps).

It cools well upto 22Â°C. 
AC worked well in 47Â°C summer heat. 
The only problem I faced with this AC is that It doesn't cools when you lower the temperature from remote. it only maintains the previous set temperature and I see no change in compressor speed and electricity consumption.
