   Review Name: Did not meet expectations 
   Review Description: The mechanics who came to install the AC were absolutely untrained, unprofessional, rude and arrogant. They installed the AC in a very poor and shabby way. Drilled a hole in the wall much bigger than what was required. Placed the waste water pipe below the copper pipes and as a result water started seeping into the wall. Had to call another mechanic to rectify installation. VOLTAS, request check expertise level of mechanics before employing them.
