   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: Best Ac in market. I searched on-line & offline line market for 1.2t inverter ac as not many make it. researched a lot. decided that settle for 1ton from bluestar or daikin. but as soon as I saw this one bought it.  Delivery was fast n installation guys were professional. though installation was costly paid rs3200 which included 750 for removing my old split. overall very happy with the product. being used for 2yrs. Tested for current consumption. at 16deg set n blower at max (4.2amp) & at 27deg at lowest blower set (1.3amps) which is awesome for 1.2ton ac. Now if to point out some cons: swing motor makes noise which very irritating & can be heard in silence of night. remote size is too big for an ac, even the lowest blower setting is high for night operation (my 6yr old sharp inverter ac is super super silent if compared to this), only vertical swing in this model (no horizontal motorized swing). that's it.not  recommended.
