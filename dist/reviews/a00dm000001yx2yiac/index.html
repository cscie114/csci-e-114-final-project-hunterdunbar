   Review Name: Did not meet expectations 
   Review Description: . I had pathetic experience so far after paying 40k.. even with fan, I feel comfortable.. dual inverter is just marketing strategy and i got fooled.. for 40k, it has no horizontal swing feature or air purifier options.. the air flow is limited to one specific region.. even when i kept the ac at 18'c, i noticed the room temperature didn't reduce much.. marq would have been better choice at 19k.. i got completely cheated.. just went for brand and lost 40k..
