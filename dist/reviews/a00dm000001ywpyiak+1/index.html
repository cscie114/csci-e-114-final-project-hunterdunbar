   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: I was in a lot of thinking which one would be best AC for me. After a lot of research I got all things which I wanted in this AC. Cools room in quick time. Great design.  Digital Display looks amazing. Remote has a lot of features including sleep mode and comes with a stand which looks cool. I will update about energy efficiency later however LG dual inverter consumes less energy. Now about Flipkart delivery it was quick and on time. Installation done within 48 hours and there was no issues. If you are thinking to buy this one I would say just go for it.
