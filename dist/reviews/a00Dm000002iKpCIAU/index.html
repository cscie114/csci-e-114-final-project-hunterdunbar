   Review Name: Worthless 
   Review Description: I have 2 Voltas AC and had same issue with both. After 2 years (total 5-6 months) of usage, the gas leaked out and now you get into a cycle of fillimg gas every season. This is 100% a scam and I will never recommend anyone buying Voltas AC or any low quality AC.
