   Review Description: I have ordered it as I am using Voltas from 3 years but this time I purchased from Flipkart and it's seems they provide defective product in just 10 days it's not cooling my 150sq feet room for continuously running for 3 to 4 hours in 16 Degree celcius I have contacted service provider they came took my AC and give me on assurance it will work but still it's not working it's just 1 months old. I am totally frustrated with such a bogus product sold by Flipkart it seems it's not a genuine or defective peice.

So make sure to buy such electronics appliances from Flipkart they are selling bogus products
