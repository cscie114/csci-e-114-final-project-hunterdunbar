   Review Name: Absolute rubbish! 
   Review Description: DISAPPOINTED.... NO COOLING.....seriously didn't expect this from blue star . I am giving this review after using it for a week, no cooling at all just gives air like normal old cooler fan, ran for more than 2 hours but no Cooling in room. Even in turbo its same no cooling just increased fan speed. Has lot of sound issue. Waste of money.... our 10+ year old LG 1 ton ac gives better cooling than this in 30 mins. Please don't buy this just seeing the 1.2 ton its waste of money better buy 1 ton or 1.5 ton.

      Installation is fine but NO demo at all. When we asked to explain the person about the fix and lock, he asked us to check with manual he wasn't even sure what was the fix and lock feature used for, no knowledge of operating.
