   Review Name: Mind-blowing purchase 
   Review Description: I am posting this review after 2 months of usage...till now everything is positive..first about installation..call voltas and get it installed from them..it costs only 500 rs...no extra charge...Jeevas installation will be much costlier...for 1.2 ton 5 star inverter AC it gives a similar colling of  regular AC of 1.5 ton...so save a lot in electricity bills...i have another 1.5 ton and 1 ton Regualr AC..this is my 3rd AC...and it gives a faster and smooth cooling than non inverter AC...IT does not have wifi or horizontal swing even though it is shown in the remote..so dont bother watsing your time checking those switches...and always get a stabilizer especially the v guard stabilizer for inverter AC whether you believe or not in such things...the PCB of inverter ACz are very costly and can get easily damaged in a voltage spike especially during lightning...I have checked many shops and ordered other AC models but returned them and finally settled on this model...Flipkart gives you the Best price for this AC than your local shops...very comfortable for a medium Indian room even on really hot days...its a bit noisy when it starts but you get used to it...once it cools down the room the noise goes away..set your fan speed to Auto..the AC will adjust it automatically for you...if you want to rapidly cool your room there is Turbo mode...Total power consumption is half of 1.5 ton Non iverter 5 star AC...My AC runs for more than 20 hours per day and the bill is not that high compared to non inverter AC...my kid love this AC ( eventhough he has been in AC since the day he was born ) so much that he tells about it to almost everyone he meets about how "cool " is his 5star Voltas 100 % copper AC...he consider this AC as his personal one..best of the 3 I have..this gives me happiness that I have made the right decesion after so much searching...what else do you need...so happy buying...PS : Dont forget to clean your AC filter well every 2 weeks so that you dont want to catch any disease from the dust and moisture  in the AC filter...trust me I am a Doctor..
