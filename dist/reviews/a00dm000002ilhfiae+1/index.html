   Review Name: Worth for the money:) 
   Review Description: Purchased in flipkart offer for Rs.27,500/- and is completely worth for it. The exterior unit is bigger in size when compared to samsung and other brands. Better go for installation from Voltas itself and they will charge a reasonable price. For me they charged Rs.2000(Rs.950 for Exterior unit stand + Rs.1050 for installation and plumbing works). Heard that flipart associated installer Jeeves will charge more. Better buy a AC Stablizer ((Works goof for me)V-Guard VG 400 1.5 Ton AC "SMART & HEAVY DUTY" VOLTAGE STABILIZER - Rs.1432(Flipkart))at the time of purchase of AC, or else you will end up in paying some extra money to the installer for stablizer. Worth for the money. :)
