   Review Name: Simply awesome 
   Review Description: Writing the review after 7 days of usage. Bought this for 34699. Cools the room within 5-7minutes despite my room not being sealed properly (i ve window gaps and door gaps). Everything is just so convenient to use. I still have not tried the sleep function though. So for so good not to complaint anything. I can't comment about power consumption right now. The warranty period of 1,5, 10 years and the lg brand trust is what made me buy this one (ive a lg washing machine which works just wow). Yeah that's it.... You can go for it if you get it around same 35k range, totally worth it. I'll update this review after sometime if needed. Thank you.
