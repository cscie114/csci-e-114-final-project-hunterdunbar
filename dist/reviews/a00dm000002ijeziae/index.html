   Review Description: The AC is an excellent product no doubt about that. Got a good deal at the time so purchased it. Does the job well. 

The only issue I faced was with the installation people. I found the gentlemen to be very rude who came to the house to install the AC. Flipkart might wanna do something about that since it isn't only me who faced this issue. 

One more thing: The people who came to deliver the AC came at around 2030hrs at night and they didn't even deliver it to my doorstep. Didn't look like some flipkart professional. I had to carry the AC to the third floor with the help of my neighbour. It was pathetic. 

I could have given a 2 easily for the product but again it would have been a biased review.
