   Review Description: One of the best AC i bought. I need window AC due to rented accommodation. You can't imagine how energy efficient it is. Using it at 27-28 degree consumed only 4.5 units in 10 hours. Also it jas a very cute and beautiful design. Operation sound is very less. Cooling is awesome. Also airflow is best because of horizontal vent. Whole room cool down within 3-5 minutes.
