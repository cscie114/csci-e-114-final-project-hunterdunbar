   Review Name: Terrible product 
   Review Description: I bought this for 43999 and got a defective product. I had to make 10calls each day to get the replacement. with the Himalayan cooling, room temp comes to 26 from 30 after 45min. after that temperature will decrease by 1 degree for every half an hour. waste of money. no way to return the product. the delivery executive also mentioned this model does not reduce the temperature like others and he gets complaints everyday for this model. my suggestion is to go for other brands.
