   Review Name: Highly recommended 
   Review Description: I have always trust in LG.. got the product just next day of ordered and install the same by LG technician just next day of delivery.. Installation is little bit expensive as Installation charge 1414, outside bracket 885 each, Drainage Pipe and Rapper, total I have paid 4031, but installation guys are very polite and professional..It tooks just 10 -15 minutes to start blowing cool air and Energy control mode is very good.. Noise level is also very low.. I am happy with the service and cooling of AC.
