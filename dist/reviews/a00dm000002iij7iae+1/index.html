   Review Name: Expected a better product 
   Review Description: I dont know whether piece i get is faulty or entire product. Cooling is very poor. When setting it to 16 temp, it is giving cooling like 24. many a times i have to turn it off and on and after ward it work as expected. Once compressor turns off it does not turn it self. Technician followed up for rating but did not asked once for how it is working. I will check it thoroughly and might return.

 I would like to add more, there is now voice from fan after 2 month. Sometime cooling drops and humid air is thrown
