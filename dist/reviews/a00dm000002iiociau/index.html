   Review Description: Well Window AC having inverter technology and friendly on pocket is something where LG Excel!

Design is very compact, AC has bearable noise , start function is really cool , cooling is good and design is avant- grade!

Look wise , I don't think any window AC can come even closer to it. As it is an inverter AC , I suppose electricity bill will be in comfort zone.

AC was delivered on Feb 26, 2021 and Installation plus demo done on Feb 28, 2021. AC is compact, hence I need help of Carpenter to refill the vacant portion.

Overall nice and excellent experience from Flipkart as well as from LG.

I prefer window AC over split, due to nature of my transferrable job, hence I went for it!
