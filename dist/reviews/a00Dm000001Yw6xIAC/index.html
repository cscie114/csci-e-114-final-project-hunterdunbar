   Review Name: Fabulous! 
   Review Description: Great deal, value for money, Thanks Flipkart & Thanks LG 

I got the best price Rs 40700/- for this LG AC JSQ19HUZD 1.5 Ton 5 Star during Big Billion day of Flipkart. 
AC comes at schedule delivery date & time with good packaging. 
Best thing was installation by LG; installation done before scheduled date as LG is fast & service is reliable. Itâ€™s very good LG took only 499/- for installation & additional 830/- for given accessories. 
Demo given by LG service person was good & helpful. 
After using my product for 2-5 days Iâ€™m impressed with this LG Ac as it comes with very good features such as Himalaya Cool, Comfort Air, Fan Speed Mode, Active energy control, Sleep Mode, Sleep Timer, dehumidifier etc & having very good built quality product with happy to mention itâ€™s pure noiseless!!!
