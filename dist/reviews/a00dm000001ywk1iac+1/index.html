   Review Name: Great product 
   Review Description: Overall, I m very happy with the product. It's value for money, however I m extremely dissatisfied with the installation staff in my region (valsad - 396001). He doesn't follow the instructions provided by LG and installed by its own way.. The evaluation test after installation has not been done by him and he wants to finish installation as early as possible.. Also he didn't care about AC unit and handle it like a waste product. I can give him only 1 star rating out of 5.
