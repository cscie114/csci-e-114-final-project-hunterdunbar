   Review Name: Unsatisfactory 
   Review Description: Honestly speeking, I m living on top floor but my cooler was working better than this AC. Even himalaya cooling is not good in Night. How would I expect it will cool my room at 44Â°C.  Completely waste of money. 

But Yes this AC have a lots of functions but we all buy AC for cooling. Don't buy this product better to go for other. 

Thanks..
