   Review Name: Terrible product 
   Review Description: After using it for 2 months, I forced to rewrite my review on this product. It's been a horrible experience so far. I started to get ch38 error which is due to gas leak. Even after the technician fixed it, it again shows the same error. Worst product of the year...shame LG
