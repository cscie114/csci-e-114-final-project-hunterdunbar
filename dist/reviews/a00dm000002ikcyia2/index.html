   Review Description: excellent product in this price range 1.2 ton 5 star inverter AC by voltas , cooling was good , little bit sound in room at high speed fan but product was good and installation was also done on time by voltas engineer On next day of product delivery . Be careful installed your voltas AC ONLY By voltas engineer to get your product warranty . if u installed your AC by 3rd party you will not get warranty by voltas . you have to pay 1500 for installation and 800 for voltas stand provided by voltas engineer .
