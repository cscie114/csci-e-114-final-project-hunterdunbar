   Review Name: Nice product 
   Review Description: Delivery was good. Installation was smooth. Cooling is perfect. But only one issue which i wanted to share is that the noise of swing is constantly coming from indoor unit and the Installation team says that it will come for sometime and then it automatically gets stop, but i don't understand one thing that if this is a new brand AC then why this kind of issue is coming. I really wanted to give 5 star but because of this my perception towards Bluestar got change & Now before recommend to anyone i would ask them to research and then go with any other brand. Also i will wait for sometime and if the issue is still there i will go for replacement. Thanks
