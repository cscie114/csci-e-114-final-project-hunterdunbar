   Review Name: Useless product 
   Review Description: Don't go for inverter AC. Inverter AC has 3 IC circuit boards. Warranty for these IC boards are only for one year. 
If it will damage after warranty, then you have to pay rs. 6000 for one IC board.

My AC's IC board of outdoor unit had damaged after 6 months from purchase date. It was under warranty but due to non availability of this board at local service dealer, I am waiting since one month in this summer period.
