   Review Name: Good quality product 
   Review Description: If voltage and earthing is good then the cooling is also like the name i.e. Himalaya Cool. Over all features are good such as different cooling modes with energy conservation feature, different fan speed, different swing modes etc. Indoor unit is super silent but the Outdoor unit is bit louder. It's been only a week's time,  AC is being used mostly during night i.e. from 10 pm to 6 am therefore it consumes at 6 to 8 units. Installation guys were from authorized LG Service Centre of my area having sound knowledge and professional etiquette.
