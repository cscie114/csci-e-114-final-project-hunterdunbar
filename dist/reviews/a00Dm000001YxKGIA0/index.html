   Review Name: Just okay 
   Review Description: AC remote stand was not there in the box.

Also my Remote has no screen light or Radium indication buttons.

Company claims that remote light will be an disturbance to the sleepers.
But to Operate remote we need another light... Isn't that disturbance to the sleepers... ??? Silly reasons..

But coiling wise its good.
Installation was pathetic.
