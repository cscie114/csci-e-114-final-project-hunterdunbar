   Review Description: Dear Team, 

The day I bought this product, it's working fine, but after few week it's remote not working tried, calling to the volats customer care but no rever back got. PCB short circuit issue .Motor not working .I really want to take action on this. They said 24 hours technical service, but really writing this is the genuine feedback and no service is provided by voltasThis is extremely worse product .

I recommend not to purchase this product
