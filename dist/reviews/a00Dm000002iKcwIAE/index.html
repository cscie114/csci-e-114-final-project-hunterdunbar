   Review Name: Just wow! 
   Review Description: When it comes to Airconditioner, nothing beats the king of India, our beloved Voltas. Have been using it from more than a decade and hence decided to get one more, as expected it is as good as it was earlier if not better. Good performance in the scorching heat and humidity. After sales is also being a string point to consider this as an option. Easy to service and parts are also affordable.
