   Review Name: Does the job 
   Review Description: The AC is very good. It cools the room pretty fast in H'Cool mode and is quite silent in normal mode.

But the LG technicians didn't do their job correctly. They were talking very rudely. They charged us around â‚¹800 for the stand of the outdoor unit but my friends and colleagues who also purchased this same AC from a local store got the stand for around â‚¹300.
Didn't expect this from LG !!!
