   Review Name: Super! 
   Review Description: Excellent! my power bill decreased. it consumes only 6-7 units in 24 hours at 27 degrees on energy saving mode, but you have to run it continuously. I ordered 3 star ac during lockdown. I got it installed from my local mechanic when LG officials didnt come for 7 days, and after installation i noticed that seller has sent 5 star AC.
