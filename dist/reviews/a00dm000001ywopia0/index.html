   Review Description: They AC is Good. BUT .. DO NOT Purchase from Flipkart.  The installation Guys CHARGE like HELL . The standard Installation is 1600 and the basic iron stand is extra 850 . I don't know what is that 1600 for . If they have to do correct drilling in the wall . That costs another 1500 bucks . so on an average you will spend around 4000 INR on installation which is mostly free in dealer shops scheme's. It is NOT OVER.  the guys who came to install cut the electric wire in the wall. I had to call an electrician to fix that and spend another 500 on that plus those fools left 2 holes in my wall trying to find the correct place for core drilling and STILL ended up cutting the wire . SO DON'T GO THROUGH HELL and DO Not buy from here
