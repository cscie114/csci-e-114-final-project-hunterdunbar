   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: The Delivery was smooth and without damage. The installation was quick and without much hassle. Overall a good delivery and installation experience. The cooling is effective but quite noisy. Dont forget to buy a voltage stabiliser and a 16 Amp three pin plug for smoother installation experience. Hope it performs the way Voltas has promised.
