   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: I've been using it for 3 months now. This AC is so silent that I can hear clicks of my wall clock in night. Cooling is excellent and yes it's energy efficient too, AC is running for 20+ hours every day and adds only 400-500 Rs/Month to Electricity Bill.
