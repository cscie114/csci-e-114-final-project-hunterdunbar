   Review Name: Best in the market! 
   Review Description: After lot of deliberation and dilemma. I choose LG for thier quality and after sale service. It cools the room in sufficient time. Don't wanna use HCAP option frequently as it may cause damage to condenser. 
I always use it in 49% capacity mode. Still it cool the room faster.. 
Although the delivery is quick ( I ordered it in 10 PM night and it got delivered next day 09 AM.) The Jeeves service took long to install. And the installation technician is also not professional. He installed improperly and not firm. (Risk of the ac to fall) and not taped the copper wire. (It was torn by him exposing it open)
I raised a ticket in Flipkart consumer care. They take swift action and alloted another technican. Now it was fixed correctly. 
Thanks Flipkart for your delivery and unblemished support.
