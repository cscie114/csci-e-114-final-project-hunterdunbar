   Review Name: Horrible 
   Review Description: According to lg service centre, inverter AC barely work above 40Â°C and does not work above 45Â°C. So it is not of any use where temparature easily go up above 40C.
Also this can't be installed (outdoor) if there is another outdoor in nearby area(5Ã—5 sqft) otherwise this will not work at all.
