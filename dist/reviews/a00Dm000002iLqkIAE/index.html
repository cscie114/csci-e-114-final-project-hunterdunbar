   Review Name: Delightful 
   Review Description: Few things like to share on Installtion. Technicians from jeeves are  very beginners in the job. does not carry the vacumiser. looks like does not  aware of importance of vacumizing the pipes. releases the gas from outdoor unit 7 to 8 times before fixing the pipes. I do not understand why he did that. cooling effect is low. could not properly aling the indoor unit. also drain pipe is inclined up. leakage issue may pop up in future.
