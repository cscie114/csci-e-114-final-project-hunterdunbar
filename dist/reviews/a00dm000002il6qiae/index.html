   Review Name: Expected a better product 
   Review Description: First i want to complaint about remote, when they are charging 40K can't even provide good quality remote? Remote screen was just a cover which can be damage easily if you have kids at home.
And you can not use remote at nights because you don't know whats happening in remote screen won't have light. vertical swing won't work for this model it seems this is useless. My old which cost 8K is swing vertical and horizontally. No auto ON/OFF if it reach good temperature. Time setting won't work in remote.
