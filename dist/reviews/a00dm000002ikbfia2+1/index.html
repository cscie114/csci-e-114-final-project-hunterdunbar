   Review Name: Must buy! 
   Review Description: Good Product. Cool a 15x14 room within 30 mins. Has a high energy ratings also.  Installation service from Voltas wasn't good at first, installation guys were pushing for extra copper pipes & other materials not needed actually. After a complain, Voltas  send other guys next day & they were really good & polite. However have to check a couple of month before actually say about the energy efficiency.
