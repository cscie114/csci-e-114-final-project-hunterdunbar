   Review Name: Wonderful 
   Review Description: First of all in word this A/C is amazing

Pros
1. Great cooling (it depends on the distance between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit, lesser the distance between the two units greatly improves the a/c performance).

2. No noise 

3. Less power consumption, there is an option to convert your A/c to 1 ton.

Cons
1. Installation is very irritating, LG never sends people on time, it took me 5 days to install the a/c
