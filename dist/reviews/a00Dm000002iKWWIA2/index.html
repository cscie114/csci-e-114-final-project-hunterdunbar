   Review Name: Ok Product, Bad service 
   Review Description: The product is ok. The service is pathetic. I had two technician from LG who came to fix the AC. They neither are well trained nor professional. The missed to put the washers and drilled multiples holes and charged around INR 2900. LG is a multinational brand needs to have some decent guys working. irrespective of how good the product is the overall experience become worst.
