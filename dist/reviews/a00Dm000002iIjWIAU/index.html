   Review Name: Really Nice 
   Review Description: room size 120 sqft with wide window, Day sunlight on two walls.
1.5 ton 5 star Air Conditioner delivered on 18th June. Flipkart delivery was not as expected because my primary number was suddenly out of service and ekart was not provided with my alternate number. finally I put request through customer service and raised a complaint. Next day I received ac in well condition. After few minutes I called LG care for installation. Engineer came in the evening, two people came, one was sincerely working on installation another was bargaining for charges.
he asked for sweets (kharcha) for installation.
he unwrapped the machine quickly without taking care of plastic wraps. drilled the wall and dust in whole house.
anyways after all the witty person asked for 1200 for installation , and 750 for frame + 50 RS for sweets. I reminded him of the offer , finally he took 1500 total. after cleaning the whole mess , I switched on the ac, and it was amazing.
within 10 min temperature was down by 2-3 degree.
after using it for 15 days points to notice are:
- if you want less electric bill then set the temperature at 26-28
- after using 9 hrs it takes around 2-3 unit total when outside temp was 35-39
-closed all gaps of windows and door to prevent any leak of temp
-always run it on low fan speed and 40% efficiency. it never compromise on cool
- on and off frequently will consume more power
-always switch off from electric board as well to minimise power wastage.
-one issue is with remote backlight. in dark room we just can't see the buttons.
