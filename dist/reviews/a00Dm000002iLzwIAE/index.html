   Review Name: Pretty good 
   Review Description: Product is really good  but those jeeves expert who came to install ac were unprofessional. They torn up the bill and also didn't connect the wires in plug properly. When ac starts , a humming sound comes from plug. Ac is good , value for money but installation team from jeeves was really bad.
