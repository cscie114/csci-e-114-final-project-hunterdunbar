   Review Name: Nice 
   Review Description: I want to point out following issues with this AC
1. There is no auto swing provided for louvres. Paying a premium price for this window AC , I would expect this feature as this is normally present in all window units.
2. Air outlet window is rather small for 1.5 ton unit. 
3. Please be aware that dimensions of this AC are smaller than a normal 1.5 ton AC. You might run into installation problems if your window opening is as per standard AC..
