<!--This was a cool feature which I found in an eleventy tutorial. You can create a javascript file and write it on build to a directory. This file takes all product ids and creates a map of lower case to case sensitive ids.-->
export default {

   {% for item in products %}

      "{{item.Id | downcase}}" : "{{item.Id}}",

   {% endfor %}
